## 1. Executive summary

Since the OCR extractor agent and the sanitizer agent were first provisioned on 2026-09-19, the project moved from "two staged agents inside a 0.1.17 stack" to a hardened, dual-workspace, multi-user v0.1.23 deployment with unified matter storage, verified end-to-end test lanes, and a complete client handover package. The work fell into four arcs: sanitizer/OCR reliability, security hardening, sandbox and auth integration for the collaboration lane (qm), and release + documentation.

## 3. Where each lane stands

- OCR lane: ocr-service (PaddleOCR) is first-class; batch OCR with a 200-page run cap, per-version caching, fail-closed empty pages, and persisted model weights. Verified live 07/07.
- Sanitizer lane: step-0 + step-1 detectors shipped (CaseNumber/Landline/IPv4 + CJK adjacency + full-width digits), long-document windowing, admission control, egress gate on pending documents. Text-native suite 59/59, E2E 15/15 after two test-script fixes.
- Collaboration (qm) lane: sandbox launch wired and verified (image repin 52e867fc), local-sandbox patch over the loopback dead-path + env forwarding, magic-link login proven in a real browser, sandbox image public.
- Research (deer-flow) lane: 222 workflows/46 categories served, matter workspace rollup, present-file auto-file into the matter, 19 MCP tools, artifacts panel with per-type preview.
- Auth: deer-flow email+password; qm one-time emailed links with Mailpit (pilot) / Resend (production); registration first-user-only; admin route POST /api/auth/users.

## 4. Open items

- Incomplete-extraction 500 is recorded as a known defect, not yet fixed (`deploy/DEFECT-incomplete-extraction-500.md`) — deliberate, client-visible contract change deferred to its own release.
- Sanitizer rule configurability (roadmap, not a defect): Tier-1 rules are compiled into `pacgate-redact` (by design - deterministic-first), and no runtime rule-management API exists. Discovered 2026-10-06 when a deer-flow report claimed CN_ID/USCC were missing: investigation REFUTED that claim (both checksum rules exist in `rules.rs`/`checksum.rs`; the reported test value had an invalid check digit), but it surfaced the real roadmap gap - a client wanting tenant-specific rules has no channel. R1 is now CLOSED: the cross-jurisdiction extension set (`PASSPORT` `E`+letter+7 / legacy `E`+8, `HK_MO_PERMIT` `H|M`+10, labelled `TW_PERMIT` 8+2, labelled `LEGACY_ID` 15-digit first-generation ID, lawyer license 17-digit via `REG_NO`) shipped with recall fixtures; tests 151/151 green. Still open: a configurable rules channel (`rules.yaml` mounted at deploy + versions folded into the SHA-256 ledger) is a design-level vendor feature request, not a bug fix - it needs its own plan (mapping/version implications), and the placeholder-code set in persisted mappings must stay backward-compatible when entity codes are added.
- QM lifecycle on Windows: resolved 2026-10-06. The old "non-durable routing across core rebuilds" note was wrong for this fleet - `qm up`/`qm down` cannot run on Windows at all (the CLI's `which()` shells `/bin/sh` → `ENOENT`, measured), so the only operative path is `compose.qm.yaml`, which bind-mounts `pi-models.ts` / `local-sandbox.ts` / docker-CLI + socket and keeps the routing and sandbox lane durable across recreates. Handbooks (EN+ZH) updated 2026-10-06: `qm.cmd up` instructions replaced with the compose path.
- ~~The working tree at memo time still carried `setup-qm.ps1` and `local-sandbox.ts` functional edits awaiting commit~~ CLOSED 2026-10-06: committed `307a048` (sandbox auto-heal + install path: sandbox-local tracked, docker-CLI fetch+SHA-verify, wrapper build) with the clean-clone first-bootstrap proof; `52c7da7` closed the three false-green gates; `ddfa54e` fixed the PS 7-only `?.` that broke `install.ps1` parsing under PS 5.1; `83b1d2a` fixed the Join-Path bug the clone proof caught.
