## What Pacgate-ai is

Pacgate-ai is your firm's private legal AI assistant. It runs on the AI PC in your office — your documents, your matters, and your research history stay on that machine. There is no firm account on any cloud storage service. When you ask the assistant a question, the text of the conversation is processed by the AI model service your firm has enabled (for speed and quality); your document files themselves are never uploaded. See *Privacy and security* below for the exact split.

Pacgate-ai has **two working modes**, each for a different kind of task:

| Mode | What it's for | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| **Research** | Deep legal research with citations, document analysis, contract review | "Research this jurisdiction's recent case law on X" |
| **Collaborate** | Share documents, approve workflows, distribute work to the team | "Share this contract draft with the M&A team for review" |

You switch between them by clicking a different link in your browser. Both run on the same AI PC; both see the same matters and documents.

## Getting started

### How to access

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)
2. Go to: **http://<your-ai-pc-ip>:8089**
   - Ask your IT person for the AI PC's IP address
   - If you're on the AI PC itself, use **http://localhost:8089**
3. You'll see the Pacgate-ai landing page with two options:
   - **"Research a matter"** → opens the research workspace
   - **"Collaborate on a matter"** → opens the collaboration workspace

### Logging in

Your IT administrator will give you:
- A username (usually your email)
- A password

Enter these on the login page. Your session stays active until you log out or close the browser.

## Mode 1: Research (deer-flow)

### What this mode does

The research workspace is for tasks that need deep analysis:

- **Legal research**: "Find recent case law on force majeure clauses in China mainland courts, with citations"
- **Contract review**: "Analyze this contract for unfavorable clauses and risk areas"
- **Document comparison**: "Compare these two contract versions and show what changed"
- **Tabular extraction**: "Extract all payment terms from these 10 contracts into a table"
- **Report generation**: "Research cross-border M&A precedent in Hong Kong and produce a cited memo"

### How to use it

1. Click **"Research a matter"** on the landing page
2. Select which **matter** you're working on (a dropdown of your firm's active matters)
3. Type your research question or task in the chat box
4. Press Enter or click Send
5. The AI will:
   - Break your request into steps
   - Search your firm's knowledge base and documents
   - Read and analyze the relevant files
   - Produce a structured response with **citations** to specific documents and pages
6. The response appears in the chat, with a panel on the right showing **artifacts** (files the AI produced)

### Understanding the response

![How an answer is generated](../docs/diagrams/svg/user-02-answer-flow.png)

- **Inline citations** look like `[1]`, `[2]` — click them to jump to the source document and page
- **Artifacts** (files produced by the AI) appear in the right panel — click to preview, download, or open
- **Tool calls** show what the AI did step-by-step (read document, search knowledge base, generate DOCX)

### Working with documents

**Upload a source document:**
- Drag a file into the chat, or click the attachment button
- Supported: `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`
- The document is stored under your matter's folder

**Generate a new document:**
- Ask: "Generate a contract review memo for matter M-001 based on the research above"
- The AI produces a `.docx` file via the document engine
- It appears as an artifact — click to download or preview

**Version history:**
- Every document has versions (v1, v2, v3...)
- Each edit or generation creates a new version
- You can view and download any previous version

### Research skills available

The research workspace comes with specialized legal skills:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| Deep Research | Multi-step research with source gathering and cross-checking |
| Systematic Literature Review | Structured review of legal literature and precedent |
| Academic Paper Review | Analyze and summarize legal academic papers |
| Consulting Analysis | Business/legal consulting frameworks |
| GitHub Deep Research | Analyze a codebase or technical repository |

The AI automatically selects the right skill based on your request. You don't need to choose manually.

## Mode 2: Collaborate (qm)

### What this mode does

The collaboration workspace is for working with your team:

- **Share documents**: "Share this contract draft with the M&A team"
- **Approve workflows**: Review and approve a document generation workflow before it runs
- **Distribute work**: "Send this research memo to all partners on matter M-001"
- **Track approvals**: See what's pending your approval and what you've approved

### How to use it

1. Click **"Collaborate on a matter"** on the landing page
2. You'll see your firm's collaboration dashboard
3. The left sidebar shows your **sessions** — each is a conversation about a specific matter or topic
4. The center is the chat area — type messages or attach files
5. The right panel shows **files** shared in this session

### Sharing documents

1. In a collaboration session, click the file/attachment button
2. Select a document from your matter (or upload a new one)
3. Choose who to share with:
   - **Specific people** (select attorneys from your firm)
   - **The matter team** (everyone on this matter)
   - **The practice group** (e.g., "all M&A attorneys")
4. Choose permission: **View only** or **Can edit**
5. Click Share

The people you shared with will see the document in their next collaboration session for that matter.

### Approving workflows

When the AI proposes an action that needs approval (e.g., "I'll generate a contract review report and share it with the team"):

1. You'll see an **approval card** in the chat
2. Review what the AI wants to do
3. Click **Approve** to let it proceed, or **Reject** with feedback
4. The AI only acts after you approve

### Ethical walls

Your firm's administrator can set **ethical walls** on specific matters. If a matter has an ethical wall:

- Only assigned attorneys can see that matter's documents
- The AI will not reference documents from a walled matter when working on other matters
- This prevents conflict-of-interest exposure

If you try to access a matter you're not assigned to, you'll see "Matter not found" — this is intentional, not an error.

## Matters and documents

### What is a matter?

A **matter** is a legal case, project, or engagement. Every document, research task, and collaboration session belongs to a matter. Matters belong to your firm (the tenant).

Your firm's matters might include:
- M-001: Smith v. Jones litigation
- M-002: Acme Corp M&A transaction
- M-003: Patent application #2026-XXX

### Document structure

Each matter has:
```
M-001 (matter)
├── Documents (versioned .docx, .pdf, .txt)
├── Uploads (source files you attach)
├── Memory (facts the AI extracted from your work)
└── Run history (what the AI did, when)
```

### Document versions

Every document is versioned:
- When the AI generates a document, it creates v1
- When you or the AI edits it, it creates v2, v3, etc.
- You can download or preview any version
- The current version is always the latest

### Citations

When the AI cites a source in its response:
- `[1]` means it's referencing a specific document and page
- Click the citation to open that document at the right page
- The verbatim quote (≤25 words) is shown alongside the citation

This is critical for legal work — every AI claim should be traceable to a source document.

## Personas

Pacgate-ai comes with legal **personas** — specialized AI assistants tuned for different practice areas:

| Persona | Practice area |
|---|---|
| M&A Partner | Mergers and acquisitions |
| Litigation Associate | Court proceedings, discovery |
| IP Counsel | Intellectual property |
| Compliance Officer | Regulatory compliance |
| Cross-border Advisor | International/cross-border matters |
| ... | 20 total, firm-customizable |

Your firm can customize personas or add new ones. Ask your administrator if you need a persona that doesn't exist yet.

## The three-tier model system

Pacgate-ai uses three model tiers for different tasks:

| Tier | Used for | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| **Main** | Deep analysis, contract review, complex reasoning | Slower, most capable |
| **Mid** | Tabular review, batch extraction, structured output | Medium |
| **Low** | Titles, short summaries, quick labels | Fastest |

You don't choose the tier — the AI automatically picks the right model for each subtask. A quick label uses Low; a contract review uses Main.

Your firm's administrator configures which models serve each tier, and the set can change over time as better models become available. The research and collaboration chat assistants may use hosted models for speed; heavy document processing runs on the office AI PC.

## Privacy and security

![What stays in the building, and what is sent](../docs/diagrams/svg/user-03-privacy-split.png)

### What stays on your machine

- **All documents** — uploaded, generated, and edited
- **All matter data** — case files, research history, memory
- **The knowledge base and search index**
- **All collaboration** — shared within your firm's network only

### What is sent to the AI model service

- **The text of your conversation** — your question and the specific passages the assistant reads to answer it are processed by the model service your firm has enabled, so answers come back fast and at high quality.
- Your document files themselves are never uploaded to that service, and no matter data is stored in any cloud account.

If a client matter requires zero external processing of any kind, tell your firm administrator before using the system on that matter.

### Who can see what

- You can only see matters you're assigned to
- Documents are scoped to their matter
- Ethical walls prevent cross-matter data leakage
- Every document access and AI action is logged (audit trail)

## Frequently asked questions

### "The AI is slow"

Deep research tasks (Main tier) take longer because they run multiple steps: search, read, analyze, cross-check, generate. A full research report may take 2-5 minutes. Quick tasks (summaries, labels) take seconds. This is normal — quality takes time.

### "I don't see a matter I should have access to"

Contact your firm administrator. They control matter assignments and ethical walls. If you're not assigned to a matter, it won't appear in your list.

### "The AI cited something wrong"

Click the citation to open the source document. If the citation is inaccurate, tell the AI in the chat: "That citation is wrong — the correct page is 15, not 12." The AI will correct itself and update its memory for future tasks.

### "Can I edit a document the AI generated?"

Yes. Download the `.docx` artifact, edit it in Word, and re-upload it. It becomes a new version (v2, v3...). The AI can also edit documents directly if you ask it to.

### "How do I share my research with a colleague?"

1. In the research workspace, the AI produces an artifact (e.g., a research memo `.docx`)
2. Switch to the collaboration workspace
3. Start a session on the same matter
4. Share the document with your colleague

### "What if the AI PC goes down?"

Your data is safe — it's on the AI PC's disk, in a Docker volume. When the AI PC restarts, Docker Desktop auto-starts the containers (if configured), and all your matters, documents, and history are preserved. If you need help, contact your IT administrator.

### "How do I get a new version of the software?"

Your administrator will tell you when an update is available. They run a one-command update script. Your data is never affected by updates — only the software engine changes. All your matters, documents, and customizations are preserved.
