"""PacGate patch (2026-10-08): prefix-aware skill allowed-tools matching.

Base: ghcr.io/jzkk720/deer-flow-pacgate:0.1.24 image version of
``packages/harness/deerflow/skills/tool_policy.py``.

Root cause fixed here: skills declare allowed-tools with bare MCP *server*
names (``pkulaw``, ``yuandian-law``, ``pacgate``), but loaded MCP tool names
are prefixed with the hyphen-normalized server name
(``pkulaw_case_keyword_get_case_list``, ``pacgate_pacgate_connector_search``).
Exact-match filtering dropped ALL 137 MCP tools once any skill declared
allowed-tools (verified live 2026-10-08; thread 44e28035 used only
bash/read_file). The filter now treats a declaration as covering every tool
whose name equals the declaration or starts with ``<declaration>_`` (hyphens
normalized to underscores), so ``qcc`` cannot swallow a hypothetical
``qccother`` server.
