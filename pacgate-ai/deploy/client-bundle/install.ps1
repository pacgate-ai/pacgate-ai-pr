#                                      (update images only; leave the repo alone)

# Resolve the PowerShell to run the two qm helper scripts with. pwsh 7 is
# PREFERRED (this dev box and the docs assume it), but a client AIPC is not
# guaranteed to have it and forcing an install just to stage qm was the wrong
# trade: all three scripts involved parse and run clean under built-in
# PowerShell 5.1 (verified with the language parser + the Out-File BOM fix in
# setup-qm.ps1). Fall back to whatever the host is already running.
#
# Get-Command pwsh also finds the WindowsApps ALIAS on a machine where PS7 is
# not actually installed; invoking that alias silently opens the Store. A
# version check cannot distinguish (a Store-installed PS7 reports 0.0.0.0
# through the alias), so the discriminator is the install shape itself: only a
# pwsh OUTSIDE WindowsApps is trusted; anything else falls back - and the
# fallback is verified-compatible, so a mis-detected PS7 costs nothing but the
# shell it would have used.

# 3b. Refresh the repo working tree (updates only).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   This script lives at <repo>\deploy\client-bundle, and much of the runtime is
#   bind-mounted straight from the repo: compose image pins, workflows/*.yaml,
#   patches/*.py, nginx/default.conf, and the config templates. Pulling images
#   alone does NOT deliver any of those. Previously the operator had to
#   remember a separate `git pull` first - the single most easily forgotten step
#   in the update path, and when forgotten the machine silently keeps running old
#   config against new images. See deploy/AIPC-UPDATE-GAP-ANALYSIS.md.
#
# SAFETY RULES (this touches a client machine):
#   - NEVER proceed with local changes to TRACKED files. Refuse and name them.
#     No auto-stash, no reset, no checkout -- all would discard someone's work.
#   - Untracked files are NOT a reason to block the refresh: git fast-forwards
#     over them. The ONE exception is a name collision, where the incoming
#     commit adds a path that is untracked here - git refuses that itself, and
#     this script pre-checks it so the operator gets an actionable message.
#   - Fast-forward only. Never create a merge commit on a client machine.
#   - Missing git, or a non-git checkout (tarball install), is a WARNING not a
#     failure - the rest of the update still works.
#
# Runs BEFORE the config renders below, so they render from the newly pulled
# templates rather than the stale ones.

# The gateway rejects auth POSTs whose Origin header is not in this list
# (csrf_middleware is_allowed_auth_origin). Browsers ALWAYS send Origin on
# POST, so a user browsing http://<machine-host>:8089 gets 403 "Cross-site
# auth request denied." on EVERY sign-in and registration attempt when the
# list is localhost-only - the compose default. Verified 2026-09-20:
#   POST /api/v1/auth/login/local with Origin http://192.168.8.88:8089 -> 403
#   same POST with Origin http://localhost:8089 -> 401 (gate passed)
# The same-origin escape does NOT work behind our ingress chain (nginx ->
# Next.js rewrite -> gateway): Next.js rewrites Host to the gateway's
# authority, so the gateway can never see the browser's LAN host.
#
# This step auto-derives the machine's own browser origins and appends them
# to .env when the operator has not set GATEWAY_CORS_ORIGINS. Existing
# values are NEVER overwritten - a machine whose operator deliberately set
# the list keeps it; a localhost-only value earns a loud warning instead.

#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it runs BEFORE the stack starts.
#
# deer-flow selects its memory storage by class path and wraps the instantiation
# in a bare `except Exception` that substitutes its own FileMemoryStorage. The
# trip-wire is a missing PACGATE_MATTER_ID: the adapter raises on it, and that
# exact raise is what the fallback catches. FileMemoryStorage never calls
# pacgate-api, so it bypasses all three matter-memory guards (the 422 scope rule,
# the 64 KiB cap, and the If-Match revision guard) - each enforced server-side.
#
# So a blank matter id does NOT mean "no memory". It means UNSANITIZED memory,
# written to disk, with nothing reporting it as wrong. That happened here on
# 2026-09-19/20 and was only found by reading the files.
#
# Ordering matters as much as the value. Running this before `up -d` means
# deer-flow never starts without a real matter, so the fallback window is zero
# rather than "briefly, on first boot".

# 6a. Bootstrap the default tenant and the admin user.
#
# WHY THIS IS HERE, and why it runs BEFORE provisioning.
#
# Nothing used to do this. A fresh install finished with ZERO users, so:
#   * login returned 401
#   * matter provisioning could not authenticate and was skipped
#   * deer-flow then started with a BLANK PACGATE_MATTER_ID, its adapter raised,
#     and get_memory_storage() silently substituted FileMemoryStorage
#   * ...which writes UNSANITIZED matter prose to disk, outside all three
#     matter-memory guards
#
# So "no admin" was not a cosmetic gap - it was the first link in the chain that
# ends with unredacted client text on disk. Found by the clean-clone proof,
# because the dev box already had an admin and could never show it.
#
# Two details are load-bearing and both were wrong in the handbook:
#
#  1. The tenant slug MUST equal PACGATE_DEFAULT_TENANT (default "default-firm").
#     The handbook inserts slug='pacgate-law', which does not match the lookup in
#     auth.rs (`get_by_slug(&state.config.default_tenant)`), so registration fails
#     with "default tenant not found: matter not found: row not found" - an error
#     that reads like a database fault and is really a naming mismatch.
#
#  2. Registration is a POST to /api/auth/register and returns 200 on success.
#     It is idempotent-safe to attempt: an existing user yields a non-2xx error
#     which this step treats as "already bootstrapped", not as a failure.

# 7e. Staleness marker: report what is ACTUALLY running, not what was pulled.
#
# The failure this guards against has no other symptom. `compose pull` fetches
# new images, but the running containers keep executing the OLD ones until they
# are recreated - and on a machine where someone has been debugging, the gap can
# be days wide. Nothing errors; the app simply behaves like the old release. A
# "what am I running" answer is the difference between diagnosing that in
# seconds and a dev logging in to poke at it.
#
# The URL is <nginx-host-port>/version - NOT /build-info. nginx maps the clean
# `/version` location onto pacgate-api's /build-info, and pacgate-api itself
# publishes NO host port (`docker compose port pacgate-api` is empty), so nginx
# is the only way in from the host. Probing /build-info at the nginx port would
# hit the deer-flow frontend instead and return HTML, so the path matters.
#
# The host port is DERIVED, not assumed. compose.prod.yaml maps 8089:80, but a
# machine can legitimately remap it (the dev box for this project runs 8081),
# and a hardcoded 8089 would silently probe nothing and report "unreachable" on
# a perfectly healthy install - a false alarm that trains people to ignore the
# check. `docker compose port` answers with whatever is actually published.
#
# The response reports the version COMPILED INTO THE RUNNING BINARY, not the
# image tag. Those record what was deployed, and the failure worth catching is
# the deployed artifact disagreeing with the process actually serving traffic.

# Reports and never fails the install: an unreachable API during a restart is

# 7f. Re-stage the qm runtime config from the tracked source.
#
# R2 in deploy/qm-pacgate/INTEGRATION-MAP.md, the largest remaining gap in the
# unattended-update goal. `setup-qm.ps1` stages deploy/qm-pacgate/ into this
# directory, and step 1 above refreshes the TRACKED copy on every -Update. But
# the RUNTIME copy is a different directory that nothing re-staged, so a qm
# config change reaching a deployed machine required re-running setup-qm.ps1 by
# hand - and that script prompts for admin email and bridge credentials, so it is
# not something to run unattended.
#
# There is a second, quieter consequence. `qm-sandbox-fingerprint.ps1` reads and
# writes the TRACKED qm.config.jsonc (its $qmDir is deploy/qm-pacgate), while qm
# actually RUNS the runtime copy. So the drift detector can report CURRENT while
# the config being executed is an older revision - the check inspects a different
# file than the one in play. Re-staging converges them, which is what makes the
# detector's answer meaningful.
#
# SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION:
#   - .env is EXCLUDED, so generated secrets are never overwritten.
#   - node_modules and .generated are excluded (machine-local, bulky, rebuildable).
#   - *.bak.* is excluded, so backups are not copied onto themselves.
#   - It copies FILES ONLY. No container is restarted and `qm up` is never run,
#     so the R4 contention between `qm up` and compose.qm.yaml cannot be triggered.
#
# A config change needs qm restarted to take effect, and that is deliberately
# left to the operator with the exact command printed - the same reasoning as
# step 7d's sandbox report. An unattended restart of a client's co-working stack
# is a worse failure than a precise instruction.

# 7g. Bring up qm (Runtime 3) on a FIRST install.
#
# WHY THIS IS NEW. Until 2026-10-03 the installer deliberately never started qm -
# every qm step only re-staged config and printed an instruction, because qm was
# an optional side-lane. The deployment model is now "every AIPC runs all three
# runtimes", so leaving qm down means the installer ships a stack that is missing
# a third of its product.
#
# WHY ONLY ON FIRST INSTALL, NOT -Update. A restart of the co-working stack is
# user-visible (qm is where staff work), and the R4 contention between `qm up` and
# compose.qm.yaml means an automated path has to pick one and be right. On a FIRST
# install nobody is mid-session, so there is nothing to interrupt; on -Update the
# operator may be in it. -Update therefore keeps the existing print-the-command
# behaviour, and this block only runs when the stack is not already up.
#
# The bridge is a SEPARATE, least-privilege service account. It is NOT the
# deployment's own PACGATE_API_EMAIL: the sandbox runs model-directed tool calls,
# so it gets its own attorney-scoped credential. Because self-registration is
# first-user-only, this block provisions that account through POST /api/auth/users
# using the admin the installer bootstrapped in step 6a.
