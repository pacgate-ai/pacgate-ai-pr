# Prove the staleness comparison against the LIVE stack.
#
# HISTORY: this test originally used the running stack as its NEGATIVE case,
# asserting the live image was pacgate-api:0.1.2 which predated /version. That
# stopped being true when the stack moved to 0.1.17, so the check could never
# pass again - a fixture-based negative case expires. It also hardcoded the nginx
# host port as 8081, which went red when compose moved to 8089.
#
# Both are now DERIVED, and the discrimination is tested SYNTETICALLY (accept the
# current version, reject an outdated one) so the negative case cannot expire.
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'
# Derived, NOT hardcoded. This was an absolute `cd` to the author's checkout, so
# on any other clone the script read THAT repo's compose file and reported on a
# machine it was not running on. Silent, because the path exists there.
