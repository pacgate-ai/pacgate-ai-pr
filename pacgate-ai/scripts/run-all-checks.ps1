# Run every local verification script and report a single pass/fail.
#
# TWO KINDS OF SCRIPT, and conflating them is a bug I hit on the first run:
#
#   GATES        exit 0 = pass, non-zero = a real failure. Nothing to interpret.
#   MEASUREMENTS exit code IS the answer. audit-aipc-update-coverage.ps1 exits 1
#                while plan 014 has open work, by design - that is it correctly
#                reporting "gaps remain", not a broken script.
#
# The first version put the measurement in the gate list, so this runner reported
# "1 of 9 SUITES FAILED" on a tree where nothing was broken. A runner that is red
# when nothing is wrong is a runner people learn to ignore - the same failure
# mode as the stale tools fixed earlier in this work. Measurements are now
# reported with their result and never fail the run; only GATES can.

    # Structural validity, separate from the string-match checks above. The
    # 0.1.14 release produced NO images because a job-level `if:` referenced the

    # died before any job started, including the build job that had been working.
