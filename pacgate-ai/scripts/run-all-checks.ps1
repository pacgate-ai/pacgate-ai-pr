# Run every local verification script and report a single pass/fail.
#
# THREE KINDS OF SCRIPT, and conflating them is a bug I hit on the first run:
#
#   GATES        exit 0 = pass, non-zero = a real failure. Nothing to interpret.
#   LIVE-STACK   exit 0 = pass, 1 = a real failure, 2 = CANNOT CHECK. Same
#   GATES        assertions as a gate, but they need the stack actually up, so 2
#                must NOT be read as a failure of the code. See below.
#   MEASUREMENTS exit code IS the answer. audit-aipc-update-coverage.ps1 exits 1
#                while plan 014 has open work, by design - that is it correctly
#                reporting "gaps remain", not a broken script.
#
# The first version put the measurement in the gate list, so this runner reported
# "1 of 9 SUITES FAILED" on a tree where nothing was broken. A runner that is red
# when nothing is wrong is a runner people learn to ignore - the same failure
# mode as the stale tools fixed earlier in this work. Measurements are now
# reported with their result and never fail the run; only GATES can.
#
# THE EXIT-2 CARVE-OUT, and why it is not a way to hide a failure: 2 specifically
# means "could not check". test-empty-extraction-gate.ps1 needs nginx, the API, the
# OCR service and credentials; on a developer's clean checkout none of that is
# running, and a red suite there teaches people to ignore the suite rather than to
# trust it. So 2 is reported as SKIP CANNOT CHECK and does NOT fail the run, while
# 0 and 1 keep their exact gate meaning - a real assertion failure is still red.
#
# This is a carve-out on the EXIT CODE, not on any assertion: nothing in this
# runner can turn an observed failure green. Both pre-existing scripts that
# already exit 2 (test-workflow-compose-wiring, test-handoff-command-safety) use
# it for the same class of "environment is wrong" error - no compose files found,
# no docs found - so the reading is consistent, and neither loses coverage.
