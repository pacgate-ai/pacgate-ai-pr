# Asserts deer-flow's memory lane is actually the SANITIZED one, and that the
# configuration cannot silently degrade to the unsanitized disk lane.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS
#
# deer-flow selects its memory storage by class PATH, at runtime:
#
#     storage_class: pacgate_deerflow_adapter.storage.PacgateMemoryStorage
#
# and get_memory_storage() wraps the whole instantiation in a bare
# `except Exception` that logs one line and substitutes FileMemoryStorage():
#
#     except Exception as e:
#         logger.error("Failed to load memory storage %s, falling back to
#                       FileMemoryStorage: %s", storage_class_path, e)
#         _storage_instance = FileMemoryStorage()
#
# That fallback is invisible from outside. A misconfigured install answers every
# health check, serves every request, and writes UNSANITIZED memory-prose to
# disk - bypassing all three matter-memory guards (the 422 scope rule, the
# 64 KiB cap, and the If-Match revision guard), because none of them live in
# FileMemoryStorage. This is not hypothetical: it already happened on this
# machine. Two native files under users/<uid>/agents/*/memory.json carry real
# matter prose ("sanitizing documents (e.g. <uuid>) at data level T3") written
# in the native v1.0 schema the adapter never emits.
#
# The adapter raises on a missing PACGATE_MATTER_ID (storage.py:62), which is
# exactly the condition that trips the fallback - and .env.example shipped it
# BLANK. So the default fresh-install path was the silent-degradation path.
#
# SCOPE DISCIPLINE: this asserts the CONFIGURATION, not the behaviour. A pass
# means "the shipped config selects the adapter, feeds it the env it requires,
# and is mounted where the server reads it" - not "the adapter sanitized
# correctly". That is tests/test-memory-scope.ps1's subject (the 422 rule) and
# the adapter's own 8 pytest rows.
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 real failure, 2 cannot check. "Cannot check" is never a pass.
