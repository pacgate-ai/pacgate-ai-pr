# Assert the firm's legal workflow LIBRARY is actually served, not the built-ins.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The 15 workflow YAMLs were bind-mounted into `deer-flow` while `pacgate-api` -
# the service that owns GET /api/workflows - had no mount and no WORKFLOWS_DIR.
# The API therefore fell back to its 10 built-in Rust definitions and silently
# served a different, smaller, generic set. Nothing errored. A client opening the
# workflow list saw the wrong data.
#
# See deploy/DEFECT-workflow-mount-wrong-service.md.
#
# The reason a guard is REQUIRED rather than optional: the failure is invisible
# from the outside. A missing mount and a missing env var both produce a
# well-formed 200 response with plausible content. Only a count (or the language
# of the titles) distinguishes the library from the fallback.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR
#
# Built-ins are 10 English workflows ("Contract Review", "Due Diligence
# Review"). The library is ~222 and its titles are Chinese. So asserting a count
# well above 10 catches BOTH faults - the wrong service and the missing variable -
# without needing to inspect compose, which would test the config rather than the
# outcome.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -File scripts/test-workflow-library-served.ps1
#   pwsh -File scripts/test-workflow-library-served.ps1 -BaseUrl http://localhost:8089/pacgate
#
# Exit codes: 0 = library served, 1 = only the built-ins (the defect), 2 = could
# not check (unreachable / unauth) - never reported as a pass.
