# PROVES the deer-flow auto-escalation target does not egress client material.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `model_routing` in deer-flow-config.yaml routes a run to the escalation target when
# the CONVERSATION HISTORY crosses a token threshold, and only when the user did not
# pick a model. That history grows with uploaded-document text and tool results, so
# the escalation path is exactly the path a client's document travels.
#
# It shipped pointing at `glm-5.3-flash-cloud` with a 20,000-token threshold --
# roughly a 30-page contract. So an attorney who uploaded an ordinary document and
# left the model picker alone had that document sent to ollama.com with no
# sanitizer, no consent and no banner. That is the firm's core promise violated by a
# default, and it needs a gate rather than a comment: a config value with no test is
# a value that regresses the next time someone edits the file.
#
# ASSERTS:
#   A1 the escalation target in deer-flow-config.yaml is NOT a cloud tag
#   A2 it resolves to a model actually DEFINED in `models:` (a typo would fall back
#      to the default at runtime and silently disable escalation entirely)
#   A3 `local_model` also resolves
#   A4 the threshold is high enough that one document does not cross it
#   A5 every model still offered to the picker is either installed or a known cloud
#      tag -- a picker entry that 404s on select is a defect this repo has shipped
#      before (see the disabled qwen3.5/gemma4-26b entries)
#   A6 the agent PATCH reports the target kind rather than always saying "cloud"
#
# Exit: 0 = all pass, 1 = a real failure, 2 = cannot check.
