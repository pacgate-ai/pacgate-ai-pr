# Verify the /build-info staleness marker against the REAL pacgate-api image on
# the REAL deployment network - not against a stub.
#
# WHY NOT A STUB. An earlier version of this test used a stub upstream that
# answered /build-info unconditionally, and it passed. It could not have failed:
# the bug that actually shipped in 0.1.13 was that pacgate_auth's middleware
# allowlist did not include /build-info, so the route returned 401 in the real
# process. A stub has no auth middleware, so it can never reproduce that. The
# test now asserts against the real binary, which means it fails when the real
# process is wrong.
#
# It also asserts the SELF-REPORTED `authenticated` field. The handler reports
# whether the auth middleware skipped it, so a caller gets proof that the skip
# list covers this path instead of having to trust a note in the source. If
# someone later removes /build-info from the skip list, the route goes back to
# 401 and this test fails on the status code.
