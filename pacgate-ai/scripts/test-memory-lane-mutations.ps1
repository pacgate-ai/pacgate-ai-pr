# Mutation test for scripts/test-memory-lane.ps1.

# A gate that cannot fail is not a gate. This breaks each assertion in turn and
# asserts the gate REJECTS, then restores every file byte-identical. Modelled on

#
# Exit codes: 0 = every mutation was rejected and every file restored,
#             1 = a mutation was ACCEPTED (the gate is blind), or a restore failed.
