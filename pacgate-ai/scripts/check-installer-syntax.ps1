# Syntax check for the installer scripts. Read-only, no side effects.
#
# Uses the PowerShell PARSER and nothing else.
#
# There is deliberately no brace-counting check here, and the reason is worth
# recording because I wrote one and had to delete it.
#
# The first version also counted '{' and '}' with a regex. That produced a false
# "BRACES UNBALANCED" on qm-sandbox-fingerprint.ps1, because '{0}' inside a
# format string looks like a brace to a regex. I then switched to counting
# parser tokens - which reported 0 braces in EVERY file and passed everything.
# $ast.Tokens is empty for ParseFile results; the AST retains structure, not the
# token stream. So the "fix" turned a noisy check into a check that could not
# fail, which is worse: it looks like verification and verifies nothing.
#
# Before re-adding any balance check, note that the parser ALREADY catches every
# case it would cover. Verified by probe: a file missing a closing brace gives
# "missing closing brace" at line 1; a file with an extra opening brace gives
# the same error at the point the block opens. A truncated file cannot silently
# pass. So the honest answer is one check, not two.
