# 013 — Credential Rotation and History Purge

Priority: **P0 — do this before anything else** · Effort: **S–M** · Depends on: —

## Status

Redaction is **done and pushed to origin**. The fork is a **one-click fix** (see
below) — no credential transfer needed. Rotation and history purge are
**outstanding**.

## Push state (verified 2026-09-16)

| Location | State |
| --- | --- |
| Local `HEAD` (`af8438c`) | redacted |
| `origin/main` (`JZKK720`) | **redacted — pushed and verified** |
| fork `main` (`pacgate-ai`) | **STILL LIVE — but fixable without credentials** |

## Recommended fix for the fork: GitHub's Sync fork (no git credentials)

`git push` to the fork fails with `permission denied` because
`git-credential-manager` holds credentials for **`JZKK720` only** (confirmed via
`git-credential-manager github list`). **No credential needs to be transferred to
git** — the fork is a strict ancestor of `origin/main`, so it can be
fast-forwarded from the browser:

1. Sign in to GitHub **in the browser** as an account with write access to
   `pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr` (its owner is the `pacgate-ai` account).
   *"Sync fork" is only rendered for users with write access* — it is not visible
   signed-out, so this step is required.
   **Use the rotated password, not the leaked one** (see Step 1).
2. Open `https://github.com/pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr`.
   GitHub reports *"This branch is 9 commits behind JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr:main"*.
3. Click **Sync fork → Update branch**.

Verified preconditions — GitHub's own compare view states *"Able to merge. These
branches can be automatically merged."*:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| fork `main` is an ancestor of `origin/main` | **yes** |
| fork has commits origin lacks (would block non-FF) | **none** |
| GitHub compare verdict | **Able to merge** (fast-forward) |
| all three credential files redacted at `origin/main` | **yes** |
| workflow fix present at `origin/main` | **yes** |

Then re-run `scripts/check-credential-state.ps1` — all three columns must read
`clean`.

> **Do NOT sign in to git (or GitHub) using the leaked password.** The value is
> compromised; rotate first, then sign in with the new one.

**Fallback** (only if you prefer git, requires interactive sign-in):

```powershell
git credential-manager github login            # sign in as the pacgate-ai account
git push https://github.com/pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr.git main
git credential-manager github logout JZKK720   # return to the original account
```

## Why this is P0

On 2026-09-15 a credential sweep found three tracked files holding **real,
working credentials** in a **public** repository. Redacting them stops *new*
exposure from fresh clones of `HEAD`. It does **not**:

- undo the exposure that already happened,
- remove the values from git history, or
- remove them from every existing clone (both AIPCs have one).

**Treat every value below as compromised. Rotation is mandatory, not optional.**

## What was exposed

| File | Exposed material |
| --- | --- |
| `pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-assets/…/pacgate-ai-remote-handbook/OPERATOR.md` | `pacgate-ai` GitHub account email, ID, and plaintext password |
| `pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-assets/…/MCP授权/法律数据库MCP.md` | Legal-portal unified login + password (chineselaw / pkulaw / qcc) |
| `pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-assets/…/MCP授权/境外法律数据库和网站.md` | CourtListener, Vaquill, EUR-Lex, Ansvars, fyopen passwords **and two API keys** |

All three were present on both `origin/main` (`JZKK720`) and fork `main`
(`pacgate-ai`), both public, introduced by `01a4644` (2026-08-13).

## Done already (2026-09-15/16)

- All 10 credential-bearing lines **redacted** in place; markdown tables left
  structurally intact so they still render.
- `OPERATOR.md`'s false claim *"This file is gitignored"* corrected, and its
  "look up the value in the table above" instruction repointed at the password
  manager.
- Root `.gitignore` hardened with a credential-hygiene block. Note the
  `pacgate-ai-assets` subtree previously had **no** guard at all.
- Repo-wide re-scan returns **CLEAN** (no literal credential values in tracked
  text files).
- Redaction pushed to `origin` and verified by reading the remote blob, not by
  trusting the push.

## ⚠️ Sequencing: do the GHCR release BEFORE the history rewrite

The two outstanding items interact, and the order matters:

1. **First, sync the fork** (one click, above) and **fire the GHCR release**
   (`plans/011` / `012`). The workflow fix now lets CI go green, and this is the
   first release carrying the `.docx` and search fixes.
2. **Then rotate and rewrite history.**

Why this order: the release publishes **image tags**, not commits. A force-push
rewrite after the release does not invalidate published tags, so clients keep
pulling the same images. Doing it the other way round means rebuilding and
re-tagging a release immediately afterwards.

Evidence this is safe: the currently published images carry **no**
`org.opencontainers.image.source` label (they predate the provenance labels
added in `48eb8c1`), so no package is bound to a specific commit. Even so,
**verify pullability after any force-push** before relying on it:

```powershell
.\scripts\check-ghcr-pull.ps1 -Targets "pacgate-ai/pacgate-api:0.1.9","pacgate-ai/pacgate-mcp:0.1.9","pacgate-ai/deer-flow-pacgate:0.1.10","pacgate-ai/deer-flow-frontend-pacgate:0.1.11"
```

### ⚠️ The purge breaks `install.ps1 -Update` on both AIPCs (found 2026-09-16)

**Status: release 0.1.13 is done, so the rewrite is now unblocked. But do NOT run
it without reading this.**

Measured blast radius (dry run, this tree):

| Measure | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Commits rewritten | **185 of 188** (`01a4644..HEAD`) |
| Tags invalidated | 7 local (`v0.1.3`..`v0.1.9`); the fork's tags are separate objects |
| Repos affected | origin **and** fork — `01a4644` is an ancestor of both |

The coupling nobody had noted: **plan 014 step 1 makes `-Update` run
`git pull --ff-only`, and a force-pushed rewrite is by definition not
fast-forwardable.** So on any machine holding an existing clone — both AIPCs —
the sequence is:

1. You force-push the rewritten history.
2. AIPC runs `.\install.ps1 -Update`.
3. `git pull --ff-only` fails; install.ps1 prints
   `[WARN] Repo has diverged from origin/main - not fast-forwardable` and
   **skips the repo refresh while continuing with the image update.**

Step 3 is the designed, safe behaviour (it refuses rather than merging), and it is
why the purge is not an emergency: the machine keeps working on its current repo
content and still picks up new images. But it means **the repo-based half of every
future update silently stops landing** on that machine until someone re-clones.
That is precisely the silent-staleness class plan 014 exists to eliminate, so the
rewrite must be paired with a re-clone of both AIPCs, not treated as a
repo-side change that arrives by itself.

Required sequence if the purge is run:

1. Rotate (Step 1 below) — unchanged, and still the part that actually reduces risk.
2. Purge + force-push both remotes.
3. **Re-clone on AIPC1 and AIPC2**, or `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main`
   on each, then verify with `.\scripts\verify-delivery-state.ps1`
   (`fork == origin` must read yes).
4. Confirm `-Update` is fast-forwardable again on both machines.

Note 3 is the step that is easy to forget, because the failure it prevents is
invisible: nothing errors, the repo just stops moving.


## Step 1 — Rotate (do this first)

Rotation must precede the history purge: the purge removes the values from
history, but anyone who already cloned has them.

### Verified account state (2026-09-16, checked directly in the browser)

**The security log shows no sign of misuse.** Every event is from Thailand
(`124.120.26.84` — this operator) or Beijing (`210.12.78.25` — the firm), with
Singapore `77.83.241.96` for the Copilot Chat app. Every login shows
`user.new_device_used` → `two_factor_requested` → `two_factor_challenge_success`,
i.e. **2FA was satisfied on every sign-in**. No unexplained geolocation, no
unrecognised access. The keys were public, but nothing indicates they were used.

That is a reason to stop treating this as an emergency — not a reason to skip it.
Published keys must still be assumed compromised.

**Personal access token revoked:** `pacgate-ghcr-push` (`write:packages`, created
2026-09-13 16:43 GMT+7 from Beijing) — **now deleted**. Verified redundant before
revoking: the release workflow authenticates with
`secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` (`build-ghcr.yml:95`) and greps to **zero** references to
any PAT secret, and no script under `scripts/` reads `GHCR_PAT` /
`PACKAGES_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`. It was superseded by the per-repo token that
0.1.12/0.1.13 already use.

**Authorized OAuth apps on `pacgate-ai` — 8, with usage:**

| App | Last used | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visual Studio Code | within the last week | **in use — keep** |
| Git Credential Manager | within the last 3 weeks | **in use — keep** |
| Cloudflare | within the last 2 weeks | **in use — keep** |
| Apify | never | revoke candidate |
| Ollama | never | revoke candidate |
| OpenRouter | never | revoke candidate |
| Tailscale | never | grant now stale; tokens already re-issued Sep 11 |
| FireCrawl | (token re-issued Sep 11) | keep if FireCrawl is in use |

The original redaction note said "remove the OAuth grant" for every app. That is
too blunt by half: three are actively used, and revoking *Visual Studio Code* or
*Git Credential Manager* would break the tooling doing this work, while revoking
Tailscale could cut remote access to the AIPCs.

### ⚠️ Two things the original plan missed

**(1) The API keys ARE consumed at runtime, so rotation is not purely external.**

Verified wiring (names, not values):

| Key | Referenced in |
| --- | --- |
| `COURT_LISTENER_API_KEY` | `compose.prod.yaml` (passed to pacgate-search) |
| `VAQUILL_API_KEY` | `compose.prod.yaml`, `.env.example`, Rust (3 refs) |
| `FYOPEN_API_KEY` | `compose.prod.yaml`, Rust (4 refs) |
| `ANSVAR_API_KEY` | `compose.prod.yaml`, `.env.example`, Rust (1 ref) |
| `YUANDIAN_API_KEY` / `PKULAW_API_KEY` / `QCC_API_KEY` | `compose.prod.yaml`, Rust (4 refs each) |
| `OPENCORPORATES_API_KEY` | `compose.prod.yaml`, `.env.example`, Rust (3 refs) |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | `qm.config.jsonc` (sandbox `secretEnv`) |

Because `compose.prod.yaml` loads all `API_KEY`-suffixed vars into the container,
**rotating one of these means editing `.env` on every AIPC too** or that connector
stops answering. That is a deployment step, not just account hygiene — and it is
why rotation needs a per-machine checklist, not only dashboard visits.

**(2) The real rotation burden is a shared Outlook account.**

At least **seven** services authenticate with `pacgate.ai01@outlook.com`
(sometimes as user `PacgateLaw`): courtlistener, vaquill, eur-lex, ansvar,
fyopen, chineselaw, pkulaw, qcc. Rotating each *service* password is
straightforward; rotating the *identity* that resets them all is the riskier
change and should be decided deliberately. The exposure includes the account
password and an MCP "统一密码" (a single shared password for the Chinese
databases), so several services likely share one secret — meaning one reset may
cover many rows.

### Actions

| Credential | Action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pacgate-ghcr-push` PAT | ✅ **revoked** (redundant) | done |
| Apify / Ollama / OpenRouter OAuth grants | ✅ **revoked** — never used | done |
| Tailscale OAuth grant | Revoke if Tailscale is not needed for AIPC access | decide |
| `pacgate-ai` GitHub password | Change, then `git credential reject` locally | **you** — I will not touch credentials |
| courtlistener / vaquill API tokens | Regenerate in their dashboards | **you** |
| The 6 Chinese/overseas DB passwords | Reset via the Outlook account; use a password manager, never a repo file | **you** |
| `.env` on each AIPC | Update the rotated connector keys | follow-up per machine |

**Good news:** GHCR images are pulled **anonymously**, so neither the password
rotation nor revoking OAuth grants affects client installs or the image
packages. Package visibility is governed separately.

### ⚠️ Correcting the priority: this is NOT a client-deployment blocker

The user pushed back with a concrete argument — *"these are the client's private
credentials, each implementation and deployment is different, so why rotate now?"*
— and **the argument is right.** I had overstated the operational coupling by
reading a comment as a requirement.

What I claimed vs what the evidence shows:

| Claim I made | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "The API keys are consumed at runtime" | True but misleading: `env_file: .env` **tolerates** them |
| "Rotating one means editing `.env` on every AIPC" | **Wrong.** No connector key is *required* — verified: not one appears as a bare `${VAR}` in `compose.prod.yaml`. They are named only in a comment (`compose.prod.yaml:32-34`) and loaded via `env_file` (`:35-36`) |
| "The real burden is a shared Outlook account" | True, but it is the **firm's** account for the **firm's** research sources |

**A client deployment is unaffected.** `deploy/client-bundle/.env.example`
declares only `PACGATE_DB_PASSWORD`, `PACGATE_JWT_SECRET`, `PACGATE_TENANT_ID`,
`PACGATE_API_EMAIL`, `PACGATE_API_PASSWORD`, `PACGATE_JWT_TOKEN`,
`PACGATE_MATTER_ID`, `PACGATE_COOKIE_SECURE`, `GATEWAY_CORS_ORIGINS`,
`OPENVIKING_ROOT_API_KEY`, `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` — **not one connector key.** Absent
them, connectors report `available=false` and search falls back to free sources:
a documented graceful degradation, not a broken install.

So rotation is **internal hygiene on the firm's own paid accounts** — worth doing,
entirely on the firm's schedule, blocking nothing.

**And it is weaker than I framed it.** The security log shows 2FA satisfied on
every sign-in and all events from Thailand (operator) or Beijing (firm). No misuse
indicators.

**One exception worth keeping distinct:** `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is listed in
`qm.config.jsonc`'s sandbox `secretEnv` and is now written by `setup-qm.ps1`. That
one **is** operationally relevant to a deployment, though still optional.

### Revocation record (2026-09-16)

Revoked via each app's own connection page
(`/settings/connections/applications/<id>`), **not** the page-level "Revoke all" —
worth noting because the app-list page exposes `Revoke` buttons that open a dialog
reading *"revoke access for everything"*. Selecting that would have revoked all 8,
including three in active use. The per-app page names the app explicitly
(*"Ollama will no longer be able to access the GitHub API"*), which is the
confirmable control.

| App | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Apify | revoked |
| Ollama | revoked |
| OpenRouter | revoked |

**Grants: 8 → 5.** Remaining are exactly the ones to keep: Cloudflare (used 2
weeks ago), FireCrawl, Git Credential Manager (3 weeks — this is what authenticates
`git push`), Tailscale (decision pending), Visual Studio Code (last week — the
tooling). Verified afterwards that `git ls-remote` still authenticates and
`verify-delivery-state.ps1` still passes: **nothing depended on the revoked grants.**



## Step 2 — Purge history

Both repos need this, and the rewrite is **destructive** — coordinate first.

```powershell
# Install once: pip install git-filter-repo
git filter-repo --invert-paths `
  --path "pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-assets/pacgate-ai/assets/assets/pacgate-ai-remote-handbook/OPERATOR.md" `
  --path "pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-assets/pacgate-ai/assets/assets/智库资料收集/智库资料收集/MCP授权/法律数据库MCP.md" `
  --path "pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-assets/pacgate-ai/assets/assets/智库资料收集/智库资料收集/MCP授权/境外法律数据库和网站.md"
```

Then force-push **both** remotes and tell anyone with a clone to re-clone rather
than pull. A rewrite changes every commit hash from `01a4644` onward.

Before publishing this, consider whether the whole `pacgate-ai-assets/` subtree
(59 files of client business material) belongs in a public repo at all. Removing
three files fixes this incident; a subtree that was never intended for the public
eye is the underlying condition.

## Step 3 — Prevent recurrence

- [ ] The `.gitignore` hygiene block is in place (done).
- [ ] Add a CI secret scan (`gitleaks` or GitHub secret scanning) so a future
      leak fails the pipeline instead of reaching `main`.
- [ ] **Extend the audit method.** The 2026-09-01 public-flip audit cleared this
      repo while all three files were present. It searched token *literals*
      (`sk-`, `ghp_`, `AKIA`, `xox`, PEM, Bearer) and never matched
      password-shaped prose or markdown tables. My own first generic scanner
      missed them the same way. A publish-readiness audit must cover:
      - CJK credential keywords — `密码` / `密钥` / `账号` / `账户` / `统一登录`
      - markdown **table** credential rows, not just `key: value`
      - filenames announcing secrets — `OPERATOR.md`, `*授权*`, `*密钥表*`
      - **the whole history**, not just `HEAD`
- [ ] Run `scripts/detect-literal-credentials.ps1` before any visibility change.

## Verification

```powershell
# Must print CLEAN
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\scripts\detect-literal-credentials.ps1

# Confirm the three files are gone from history
git log --all --oneline -- "**/OPERATOR.md" "**/法律数据库MCP.md" "**/境外法律数据库和网站.md"

# Confirm the repos still serve images (rotation must not break this)
.\scripts\check-ghcr-pull.ps1 -Targets "pacgate-ai/pacgate-api:0.1.9"
```

## Definition of done

- Every credential in the table above is rotated.
- OAuth grants on the `pacgate-ai` account reviewed and pruned.
- Both repos rewritten and force-pushed; collaborators advised to re-clone.
- `git log --all` no longer finds the three files.
- A secret-scanning gate exists so the next one fails CI.
- Decision recorded on whether `pacgate-ai-assets/` stays public.
