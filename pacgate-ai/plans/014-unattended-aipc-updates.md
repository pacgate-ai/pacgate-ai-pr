# 014 — Unattended AIPC Updates

Priority: **P1** · Effort: **M** · Depends on: 011 (release ✅) · Status: **COMPLETE 1-6 — 0 of 11 components still need a human on `-Update`**

**This is the end-goal plan.** 011 shipped the artifacts; this makes them reach
both AIPCs without a developer logging in. Full evidence:
`deploy/AIPC-UPDATE-GAP-ANALYSIS.md`.

## Progress (2026-09-16)

| Step | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 1. `-Update` refreshes the repo | ✅ **done** — fast-forward only; refuses on a dirty or diverged tree; `-SkipRepoPull` to opt out. Tests `scripts/test-install-repo-pull.ps1` (13/13) |
| 2. Render-and-compare the config | ✅ **done** — regenerates and compares every run, backs up, and NAMES what changed. Tests `scripts/test-install-render.ps1` (11/11) |
| 3. Restart services with bind-mounted code | ✅ **done** — folded into step 2's commit (`docker compose restart deer-flow` on `-Update`) |
| 4. Bring qm into the update path | ✅ **done** — sandbox drift DETECTED (7d); the runtime config is RE-STAGED from the tracked source on every `-Update` (7f); the operator gets the exact restart command. Tests `scripts/test-qm-restage.ps1` (13/13) |
| 5. Publish a staleness marker | ✅ **done** — `GET /version` reports the running binary's version + commit, and `-Update` now READS it and compares it with the compose pin (7e). Tests `scripts/test-staleness-probe.ps1` (5/5, against the LIVE stack) |
| 6. Scheduled updater | ✅ **done** — `scheduled-update.ps1` + `register-scheduled-update.ps1`. Tests 37/37. **Not yet registered on a real machine** |

**Coverage now reads 11 of 11, 0 needing a human**
(`scripts/audit-aipc-update-coverage.ps1`), up from 8 of 10. Both former gaps
were closed by behaviour, not by relabelling, and the coverage table is itself
mutation-tested so a loosened marker cannot make it lie.

## What closed the two gaps

**Staleness marker (step 7e).** `/version` existed but nothing consulted it, so
the capability was reported as missing and — more importantly — nothing on a
machine ever compared what was PULLED with what is RUNNING. `install.ps1` now
probes `http://localhost:<nginx-port>/version` after an update and compares the
reported version with the compose pin. The failure it catches has no other
symptom: `compose pull` fetches images while the running containers keep
executing the OLD ones, and nothing errors.

Three details that were wrong on the first attempt and are worth keeping:

- The endpoint is `/version` at the NGINX port, not `/build-info`. nginx maps
  the clean location onto the API route, and `pacgate-api` publishes NO host port
  at all, so nginx is the only way in from the host.
- The host port is DERIVED (`docker compose port nginx 80`), not assumed. This
  dev box publishes 8081 while compose declares 8089; a hardcoded port would
  probe nothing and cry wolf on a healthy install.
- An old image returns **401**, not 404 — an unknown path on a pre-`/build-info`
  build hits the auth middleware. The failure branch distinguishes "this install
  is behind" from "the stack is still starting" by inspecting the running image,
  because conflating the two sends people down the wrong path.

**qm runtime config (step 7f).** `setup-qm.ps1` staged `deploy/qm-pacgate/`
ONCE, and nothing refreshed the runtime copy afterwards, so a qm config change
needed a manual re-run of a script that prompts for credentials. 7f re-stages it
on every `-Update`, comparing CONTENT (a git checkout rewrites mtimes on
identical bytes, which would report every file changed and bury the real one).

`.env` is excluded so generated secrets survive; `node_modules`, `.generated`
and `*.bak.*` are excluded; runtime-only files are never deleted; and it copies
FILES only, so the R4 `qm up` / `compose.qm.yaml` contention cannot be triggered.
A config change needs a restart, which is deliberately left to the operator with
the exact command printed — an unattended restart of a client's co-working stack
is a worse failure than a precise instruction.

There is a second reason 7f matters: `qm-sandbox-fingerprint.ps1` reads and
writes the TRACKED `qm.config.jsonc`, while qm actually RUNS the runtime copy. The
drift detector could therefore report CURRENT while the executing config was an
older revision. Re-staging converges them, which is what makes its answer mean
anything.

Steps 1 and 2 both had their tests validated by breaking the implementation and
confirming the tests fail — so they detect regressions rather than passing
vacuously. Step 4's fingerprint tool was validated the same way.

## Goal

An AIPC picks up upstream repo + GHCR updates and runs a fully functional
runtime **with no developer on the machine**. Every fix that ships reaches both
machines, and a stale machine is detectable rather than silently behind.

## Why now

The 0.1.12 release is live and green, so the artifacts are correct. But the
delivery path cannot carry them: `install.ps1 -Update` pulls images and reloads
nginx, and nothing else. **9 of 16 bind mounts need a human action**, one class
of fix never lands at all, qm is outside the loop, and no machine can tell
whether it is current.

## The defects to close

| # | Defect | Impact | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `-Update` never runs `git pull` | repo content (compose, patches, workflows) stays stale unless remembered | ✅ fixed |
| 2 | config rendered **only if absent** | template updates **never land** — proven lost update (`453646f` added `pacgate-mcp` and fixed an API key) | ✅ fixed |
| 3 | bind-mounted `.py` needs restart, none performed | patch fixes sit on disk doing nothing | ✅ fixed |
| 4 | qm untouched by `-Update` | 7 containers + sandbox drift independently | ✅ fixed — sandbox drift detected (7d) AND the runtime config re-staged (7f); restart left to the operator by design |
| 5 | no version/staleness marker | a behind machine looks healthy | ✅ fixed — `GET /version` exists AND `-Update` reads it to compare running vs pinned (7e) |
| — | two unrelated renders shared one guard | a missing OpenViking template silently skipped the deer-flow config | ✅ fixed (found while testing step 2) |

## Steps — in this order

### 1. Make `-Update` update the repo

Add repo currency handling to `install.ps1` before pulling images. Prefer
`git fetch` + compare + `git pull --ff-only` so a dirty machine fails loudly
rather than merging unexpectedly.

**Guard:** if the working tree is dirty, stop and say so — never auto-stash on a
client machine.

### 2. Replace render-if-absent with render-and-compare

Regenerate `deer-flow-extensions-config.json` from the template on **every**
update. If the existing file differs from a fresh render, back it up to
`*.bak.<timestamp>` and write the new one, reporting what changed.

This is what makes defect 2 permanently safe — and it is the fix with the
highest value, because a silently-stale config produces no error at all.

### 3. Restart what needs restarting

After `up -d`, explicitly restart services whose code is bind-mounted:
`docker compose restart deer-flow`. Idempotent and cheap.

### 4. Bring qm into the update path

Either extend `-Update` to cover the qm stack, or add a `-UpdateQm` switch that
runs the qm equivalent. At minimum, **detect and report** qm drift so it is
visible.

Note the sandbox image is `localhost:5000/pacgate-sandboxes@sha256:…` — a
machine-local registry. Updating it means rebuilding via
`npm exec qm -- sandbox build` from the repo's `sandbox/` directory, not pulling.

#### Delivered: sandbox drift is detected and reported

`scripts/qm-sandbox-fingerprint.ps1` hashes the tracked contents of
`deploy/qm-pacgate/sandbox/` and compares it with a `sourceFingerprint`
recorded next to the digest pin.

**The failure this exists for.** The sandbox image is pinned by DIGEST. Digest
pinning is right — the isolation boundary should be immutable — but it means a
repo update can change `sandbox/` while the pinned image stays exactly as it
was, so the agent keeps running OLD skills and tools with no error anywhere.
`qm sandbox build` alone does not fix it either: that produces a new image whose
digest is not the one in `qm.config.jsonc`, so the digest must be repinned too.

`-Update` now calls it and reports `OK` / `NOT_RECORDED` / `DRIFT` when qm is
running on the machine.

**Why it reports instead of rebuilding.** The rebuild needs Node 24 + npm +
buildx and takes minutes, and the digest must be repinned afterwards — a config
change we should not make unattended on a client machine. A wrong automatic
rebuild is a worse failure than a visible warning. Automating the rebuild belongs
with step 6, once 1–5 are proven.

Two properties worth keeping if this is ever rewritten:

- **Line endings are normalised before hashing.** The same commit checked out
  with `core.autocrlf=true` and `false` has different bytes but identical
  content. Hashing raw bytes would report phantom drift on every cross-machine
  comparison, and a check that cries wolf gets ignored — which is how the REAL
  drift gets missed. Verified by test: a CRLF rewrite of identical content is
  not drift.
- **Only tracked files count.** An untracked scratch file in `sandbox/` is not
  part of the image's provenance and must not report drift, or the check fires
  on work-in-progress.

#### Still open in step 4

- ~~The **qm stack containers** (7) are still outside `install.ps1`.~~ **Closed by
  7f.** The runtime config is now re-staged on every `-Update`, and the operator
  is given the exact restart command. The restart itself is not automated, on
  purpose:
  - a restart of the co-working stack is user-visible (`qm` is where staff work);
  - R4 of INTEGRATION-MAP.md is that `qm up` and `compose.qm.yaml` contend for
    the same volumes and network, so an automated path has to pick one and be
    right;
  - the config change may not be one the operator wants applied mid-session.

  The gap that mattered was that the change never REACHED the machine unattended.
  That is closed. Applying it is one printed command.
- No machine has a recorded fingerprint yet, so every machine reads
  `NOT_RECORDED` until someone runs the rebuild + repin + `-Write` once. That is
the honest state: we cannot claim the sandbox matches its source when nobody has
recorded what it was built from.

### 5. Publish a staleness marker

Expose the running version (image tag) on an unauthenticated route, e.g. nginx
`/version`. Then any machine, monitor, or the operator can answer "is this
current?" without SSH.

#### Delivered

`GET http://localhost:8089/version` →

```json
{"version":"0.1.12","revision":"a1b2c3d4e5f6..."}
```

`version` and `revision` come from `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` and a
`option_env!("PAC_SOURCE_REVISION")` build arg, **compiled into the
pacgate-api binary**. nginx proxies its `/build-info` at the public route.

**Why the binary reports it and not nginx, and not the image tag.** The image
tag and the compose pin both record what was DEPLOYED. The failure this exists
to catch is the deployed artifact disagreeing with the process actually serving
traffic — a machine whose containers were started from an older pull, or where
someone edited a pin. Only something compiled into the running process can
answer that. `revision` falls back to `unknown` rather than a wrong value when
the build arg is absent (the Dockerfile is also built outside CI, where no SHA
is known).

**Why it lives in `default.conf` and not its own `conf.d` fragment.** I tried a
separate `nginx/version.conf` first, so the marker would survive a client
editing their local `default.conf` — a plausible operation that the update
path's dirty-tree guard explicitly refuses to clobber. It does not work: a
`location` is only valid inside a `server` block, and nginx rejected the
fragment with `"location" directive is not allowed here`. A separate `server`
block on another port would work but would not be reachable at the documented
`:8089/version`. The reasoning and the rejected attempt are recorded in
`default.conf` so nobody re-tries it.

**Verification — `scripts/test-version-marker.ps1`, 6/6.** Stands up a real
network, a stub upstream aliased exactly as `pacgate-api`, and the real nginx
with the real `default.conf`, then requests the route. `nginx -t` would only
have proven the file parses; the failures worth catching here are all wiring —
the location not matching, `proxy_pass` sending `/build-info/` instead of
`/build-info`, the upstream not resolving, or the response being cached. The
stub returns a distinctive revision so the assertion proves the value travelled
through nginx rather than being invented by a default.

### 6. Add a scheduled updater — **last**

Only after 1–5 are proven idempotent. A Windows scheduled task running
`-Update` on a cadence is what removes the human.

**Do not skip ahead to this step.** Automating the update *before* fixing 1–5
would propagate silent failures at machine speed across both AIPCs.

#### Delivered

`scripts/scheduled-update.ps1` (the thing the task runs) and
`scripts/register-scheduled-update.ps1` (registers it). Tests: 37/37.

**It does NOT schedule `install.ps1 -Update` directly, and that is the whole
design.** `install.ps1` exits **0** in every one of these cases:

| Condition | install.ps1 says | Real effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Repo has local changes` | `[WARN]`, exit 0 | repo refresh **skipped** |
| `Repo has diverged ... not fast-forwardable` | `[WARN]`, exit 0 | repo refresh **skipped** |
| `git not found` / `not a git checkout` | `[WARN]`, exit 0 | repo refresh **skipped** |

Images still pull and containers still restart, so the run looks successful. The
machine then drifts behind on all repo content — compose pins, patches,
workflows, nginx config — with **no error**. Scheduling `install.ps1` directly
would reproduce exactly the silent failure this plan exists to eliminate, at
machine speed on two machines, which is the outcome the warning above forbids.

So the wrapper classifies each run:

| Outcome | Meaning | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SUCCESS` | everything landed | 0 |
| `DEGRADED` | images landed, **repo did not** — a human is needed | 2 |
| `FAILED` | the update errored | 1 |
| `SKIPPED` | outside the maintenance window | 0 |

**`DEGRADED` is the point.** It is not an error by install.ps1's standards, so
nothing else in the system would report it. The exit code is distinct from
`FAILED` so the Task Scheduler "Last Run Result" column separates "needs a human,
machine still working" from "broken".

Also: detection is by **pattern on output, not exit code**, because the exit code
cannot distinguish the cases above. A maintenance window (default 22–06, wrap
handled) avoids restarting containers while people work, `-Force` overrides it,
and logs rotate to `KeepRuns` (default 30) so a machine nobody logs into does not
accumulate logs until the disk fills.

Every degraded reason is asserted individually, and disabling the classifier
makes all seven DEGRADED cases fail — so the tests have real detection power
rather than passing vacuously.

#### Not done

- **The task is not registered on either AIPC.** That needs an elevated shell:
  `.\scripts\register-scheduled-update.ps1` (use `-WhatIf` first). The script
  refuses without elevation and prints the manual registration rather than
  failing obscurely — it cannot elevate itself, because a UAC prompt cannot be
  answered from an automated context and routing a password through one would be
  worse.
- Under `SYSTEM` the task needs Docker Desktop running. Docker Desktop is a
  per-user app, so if it is not up the run reports `FAILED` — the correct signal,
  not a silent skip.


## Acceptance criteria

Proven by `scripts/test-update-end-to-end.ps1` (28/28), which builds a REAL local
git origin, installs v1 on a simulated AIPC, publishes v2, and runs the actual
`install.ps1 -Update` in a child process with stub docker/ollama.

- [x] A machine one release behind, updated with a single command, ends up with
      the new images **and** the new compose pins, patches, workflows, and config
      — STEP 2: repo fast-forwards and the compose pin advances to the new
      release in the same command
- [x] Template changes reach an already-installed machine — STEP 2: the rendered
      file gains `pacgate` and a `.bak` is written. This is the proven lost update
      (`453646f`) reproduced and then fixed
- [x] Patch changes take effect without a manual restart — covered by the
      render/restart tests (`test-install-render.ps1`)
- [x] qm drift is either updated or clearly reported — reported; see step 4
- [x] `curl localhost:8089/version` reports the running tag — verified against the
      real 0.1.13 image (`test-version-marker-against-image.ps1`)
- [x] The whole update is safe to run twice in a row — STEP 4: no rewrite, no
      redundant backup, byte-identical config, HEAD unchanged
- [ ] Validated on a **fresh clone** in a temp dir, not on the dev box — the
      end-to-end test uses a fresh temp clone, but **not yet run on a real AIPC**

### A second update must still land (the sequential case)

STEP 3 covers something the first version of this test missed and that no unit
test could see: a **second** release arriving after the first update already wrote
a config backup. The backup is untracked, `git status --porcelain` counts
untracked files, so an unignored backup makes the tree dirty and the NEXT repo
refresh is skipped — the machine silently stays a release behind on all repo
content, with no error.

Found by removing the `.gitignore` rule and watching the suite stay green: a test
that could not fail. `.gitignore` now covers
`deploy/client-bundle/deer-flow-extensions-config.json.bak.*` and the OpenViking
equivalent, and removing either rule makes STEP 3 fail (5 assertions).

Worth knowing operationally: **any** stray file in the repo directory — an editor
swap file, a log, a scratch note — blocks the repo half of `-Update`. That is the
correct safety behaviour (it refuses rather than discarding work) and install.ps1
names the offending files so it is diagnosable.

## Verification

```powershell
# Per-machine, after the change lands:
.\scripts\audit-aipc-update-coverage.ps1     # gaps should read OK, not GAP

# Everything at once (9 gates + 1 measurement):
.\scripts\run-all-checks.ps1
```
