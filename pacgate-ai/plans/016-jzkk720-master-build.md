# 016 - Make JZKK720 the Master of the Whole Build (E2E)

Status: IN PROGRESS. Tasks 1 and 2 are DONE (commits 2918487, e9fdece).
Task 3 is blocked on a user action.

Goal: make JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr the release authority for all four Pacgate
images - code, tags, Actions and GHCR - so one account owns the build E2E.
pacgate-ai demotes to a read-only mirror.

This supersedes the 2026-09-17 model in e3413d3, which had the roles inverted.

## The proven blocker (dispatch evidence, run #10)

    #20 exporting manifest list sha256:b2abacef... done
    #20 ERROR: failed to push ghcr.io/jzkk720/pacgate-api:0.1.14
    ERROR: denied: permission_denied: write_package

The LOGIN SUCCEEDED and the job declares `permissions: packages: write`, so
this is NOT a token-scope problem. It is package OWNERSHIP:

    jzkk720/pacgate-api          repository=(empty)   exists, NOT repo-linked
    jzkk720/deer-flow-pacgate    repository=(empty)   exists, NOT repo-linked
    jzkk720/pacgate-mcp          404                  does not exist
    jzkk720/deer-flow-frontend   404                  does not exist

Contrast the fork, which publishes fine:

    pacgate-ai/pacgate-api  repository=pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr   <- LINKED
    jzkk720/pacgate-api     repository=(empty)                    <- not linked

A package created BY a workflow is auto-linked to that repo and IS writable by
GITHUB_TOKEN. These two predate the repo and were created by a manual
`docker push`, so they never got the link.

CONSEQUENCE: a PAT with write:packages is REQUIRED. Task 3 is not optional.

RETRACTION: an earlier draft of this plan asserted "same owner => GITHUB_TOKEN
suffices => no PAT needed" and marked Task 3 skippable. That was WRONG - an
inference from token scope to write ability, which only a real dispatch could
distinguish. Do not re-derive it.

## DONE: Task 1 - JZKK720 Actions executes

Runs #1-#9 showed jobs=0; run #10 produced a real job. Correction: the earlier
audit called jobs=0 the "invalid-workflow signature". The real cause is the
package-ownership denial, which applies to all 8 pre-fix failures.

## DONE: Task 2 - namespace pinned to jzkk720 (commits 2918487, e9fdece)

  .github/workflows/build-ghcr.yml   pin flipped, warning inverted,
                                     GHCR_RELEASE_PAT, header rationale
  scripts/test-workflow-namespace.ps1  34 assertions (was 12)
  scripts/test-workflow-mutations.ps1  4 stale anchors; 9/9 caught

Two bugs found while doing it:

1. CASE. github.repository_owner preserves the account's real capitalization
   (JZKK720) while registry paths are lowercase (ghcr.io/jzkk720). A raw shell
   compare emits a warning about a 403 that will not happen - training the
   reader to ignore the warning that DOES matter. Both sides are lowercased.

2. MY INDENTATION BUG (fixed in e9fdece). The PAT rename left one continuation
   `echo` at 12 spaces where its neighbours are at 10. Inside `run: |` that is
   a shell script, so the line became an argument to the echo above instead of
   a command. It did not fail the run because that step is
   `if: login.outcome != 'success'` and the login succeeded - which is the
   danger: a latent break on the error path, firing only when someone needs it
   to explain a failure. Check indentation widths NUMERICALLY; 2 spaces are
   invisible to reading.

EXPECTED ONGOING FAILURE: test-workflow-namespace.ps1 reports the 8-pin check
as FAIL until Task 5 repins compose. That is the invariant working, not a bug.

## Task 3 - add GHCR_RELEASE_PAT (REQUIRED, user action)

  - Create a classic PAT as JZKK720 with write:packages, read:packages.
    Do NOT paste it into chat.
  - Add it as a repo secret named GHCR_RELEASE_PAT at
    https://github.com/JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr/settings/secrets/actions
  - Re-run Task 4 and confirm the push step succeeds.

Alternative needing no PAT: delete the two UNLINKED packages in the GHCR UI,
then re-run - a package created by the workflow is auto-linked and
GITHUB_TOKEN can write it. Nothing pins their tags (0.1.0-0.1.2, superseded).
But deletion is IRREVERSIBLE, so it needs explicit owner approval.

2FA WALL: deleting repository variables hits a 2FA "Confirm access" prompt.
Do not attempt to bypass - it is the account owner's second factor.

## Task 4 - build the first release, flip packages public

  1. git rev-list -n1 v0.1.14        # MUST be the intended commit
     git push origin v0.1.14
     git ls-remote origin refs/tags/v0.1.14   # verify; do NOT trust --dry-run
  2. Confirm the run goes green. A failure at "Build & push" with
     `denied: permission_denied: write_package` means Task 3 is not done.
  3. Job logs need auth; the user's own git credential works:
       $c = "protocol=https`nhost=github.com`n`n" | git credential fill
       # extract password=..., NEVER print it
  4. Flip all four packages public. UI-ONLY: the REST PATCH .../visibility
     endpoint 404s for personal-account packages even with write:packages.
     New packages default PRIVATE; the only symptom is a failed anon pull.
  5. THE GATE - verify anonymously, all four must be HTTP 200:
       .\scripts\check-ghcr-pull.ps1 -Targets `
         "jzkk720/pacgate-api:0.1.14","jzkk720/pacgate-mcp:0.1.14", `
         "jzkk720/deer-flow-pacgate:0.1.14","jzkk720/deer-flow-frontend-pacgate:0.1.14"
     STOP if any is not 200. (401 = still private, 404 = tag absent.)
  6. Confirm the two historical client-visible bugs are fixed IN the images:
       docker run --rm --entrypoint cat .../pacgate-mcp:0.1.14 /app/requirements.txt
         # expect markitdown[docx,pptx,xlsx,pdf]>=0.1.5
       docker run --rm --entrypoint sh .../pacgate-api:0.1.14 -c \
         "grep -iE 'hnsw|ivfflat' /app/migrations/002_rag_schema.sql"
         # expect hnsw
  7. Confirm the FRONTEND image is BRANDED (guards the d22ef48 regression):
       docker run --rm --entrypoint sh .../deer-flow-frontend-pacgate:0.1.14 -c \
         "grep -rl pacgate /app/.next 2>/dev/null | wc -l"
         # expect > 0. Zero means the overrides step was skipped and the image
         # lost the PacGate customizations - the exact defect d22ef48 fixed.

## Task 5 - repoint every pin (ONLY after Task 4 step 5 passes)

  1. Confirm the check fails first: test-workflow-namespace.ps1 -StaticOnly
  2. Repin the 8 images in deploy/client-bundle/compose.prod.yaml and
     compose.bundle.yaml: ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/ -> ghcr.io/jzkk720/
     LEAVE the volcengine/openviking@sha256 pin and any yc-software/qm images.
  3. Sweep the 36 files mentioning jzkk720, CLASSIFYING each:
       client-facing (READMEs, client-bundle/README-client.md,
         AIPC*-HANDOFF-PROMPT*.md, DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md, handbooks/*) -> UPDATE
       build/CI (README-BUILD.md, build-*.ps1, the workflow) -> UPDATE
       dated records (plans/*, *AUDIT*.md, docs/superpowers/specs/*) ->
         DO NOT REWRITE; they record what was true then. Add a "superseded by
         plan 016" line only where a reader could run a stale command
       incidental (.gitignore, pacgate-ai/crates/**, patches/*.patch) ->
         INSPECT EACH; these are fixtures or upstream URLs, not image pins
     DO NOT BLIND-REPLACE "pacgate-ai": it is BOTH the GHCR namespace AND the
     build context path `pacgate-ai/Dockerfile` (a directory in this repo).
     Changing the second breaks the build.
  4. Re-run guards and RE-DIFF. Expect the namespace check to now PASS.
  5. Commit.

## Task 6 - fresh-clone E2E (not optional)

This dev box accumulates credentials, models and rendered gitignored configs
that mask fresh-clone failures.

  1. Clone to a real (non-8.3) temp dir:
       git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr.git $dir
  2. Confirm the compose pins resolve and no docker login is in the path.
  3. Pull all four anonymously from the clean clone - the client's experience.
  4. .\scripts\test-install-repo-pull.ps1      -> expect 29 passed, 0 failed
  5. .\scripts\audit-aipc-update-coverage.ps1  -> expect 11 of 11, 0 gaps
  6. Clean up. 7. Record evidence here. If anything failed, do NOT claim done.

## Task 7 - demote the fork in the docs

  1. deploy/README-BUILD.md: single model (JZKK720 = authority, pacgate-ai =
     read-only mirror), the secrets table (GHCR_RELEASE_PAT REQUIRED + why),
     both release paths (prefer dispatch).
  2. Supersede docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-17-remove-jzkk720-image-mirror-design.md
     - it argued the OPPOSITE model and was implemented in e3413d3. Do not
     delete; add a SUPERSEDED header.
  3. Add the plan index entry; log the release in plans/007-delivery-log.md.
  4. Commit.

## Task 8 - sync the fork and verify parity

  1. git push origin main
  2. FORWARD-PORT d22ef48 (frontend overrides) - see the divergence below.
  3. Sync the fork in the browser (fork page -> Sync fork -> Update branch).
     Branch push to the fork also works via git; a TAG push does not.
  4. Verify with git ls-remote on BOTH remotes - identical SHAs.

## UNFIXED divergence requiring a forward-port

    origin/main = e9fdece   (has: install.ps1 fix, namespace flip)
    fork/main   = 0cd785e   (has: d22ef48 frontend-overrides CI fix)

NEITHER contains the other. The fork's d22ef48 is a real fix origin needs: the
workflow cloned upstream deer-flow and built it directly, SKIPPING
deploy/frontend-patches/files/ (5 branded files), so every CI-published
frontend image silently lost the PacGate customizations - measured as 0
pacgate-marked files in .next vs 9 in the locally-built image. Forward-port it
before the next frontend release.

## Global constraints

  - NEVER repin compose before the jzkk720 packages are public and anon-200.
  - Images are PUBLIC by design. No docker login ghcr.io on the client path.
  - pacgate-ai and jzkk720 are USER accounts, not orgs.
  - Tag push to origin works. Branch push to the fork works; TAG push does not.
  - ALWAYS verify with git ls-remote - never the UI, never a --dry-run (it
    reported success for a tag that did not exist).
  - BEFORE pushing any tag, run `git rev-list -n1 <tag>`. A stale local tag
    pushed the wrong commit and reproduced a documented failure.
  - AFTER any mutation suite, RE-DIFF the guarded file before committing.
    Confirm .git/mutation-guard-backup is absent first.
  - Guard scripts must be read with `git show <tag-sha>:<path>`, because a tag
    push builds from THE TAG'S COMMIT, not the working tree.
  - Version pins live in 4 files: Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, both compose files.
    Use scripts/bump-release-version.ps1.

## Rollback

Task 5 is the dangerous one. If the client install breaks after repinning,
revert that commit: compose returns to ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/*, whose images stay
public and pullable - a safe instant fallback. Task 4's packages are additive.

## Known limits (do not try to "fix" these)

  - Visibility flip is UI-ONLY for personal accounts; the REST PATCH 404s.
  - A tag push builds from the tag's commit; dispatch decouples tag from code.
  - Non-existent jzkk720 packages report 403, not 404 - absence and privacy
    look identical anonymously.
  - A --dry-run push can report success for a ref that does not exist.
  - Deleting repository variables hits a 2FA wall. Flag it for the user.


docs(plan-016): record the transient release gap and the now-clean fork

Two things that must be on the record before the maintainer syncs the fork.

1. THE FORK IS NOW A CLEAN FAST-FORWARD TARGET. It was not before this work.
   pacgate-ai is a TRUE FORK of JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr (fork=true, parent and
   source both JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr). It held d22ef48, which origin lacked, so
   the two trees had diverged in BOTH directions. GitHub's only offer in that
   state is "Discard N commits" - destructive. The content was forward-ported in
   c87a75d and the fork merged in 45b210a so its commit is now an ANCESTOR.

     fork   0cd785e -> 7 behind, 0 ahead, ancestor of origin/main
     Sync fork is now a plain fast-forward that discards nothing.

   The merge is content-neutral: both sides added the identical 14-line step
   relative to merge base 0d065f9, and the step count in the file is verified
   to be exactly 1 afterwards (not 2) - the specific risk of merging a change
   already applied.

2. THERE IS A TRANSIENT RELEASE GAP, and it should be stated rather than
   discovered. Flipping GHCR_NAMESPACE to jzkk720 applies GLOBALLY, so a release
   dispatched from the FORK now also targets jzkk720 and hits the same
   permission_denied. Until access to the jzkk720 packages is granted, NO
   release can ship from either repo.

     Impact: release only. Clients are unaffected - all four
     ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/*:0.1.14 images remain PUBLIC (verified 200), and the
     compose pins are untouched, so every install and update keeps working.
     Escape hatch if an urgent release is needed before then: dispatch with the
     `namespace` input set to pacgate-ai, which the workflow routes through the
     old target (the precedence is input > pinned > owner).

Unblocking options, both user actions:
   A. Add a PAT with write:packages as repo secret GHCR_RELEASE_PAT on JZKK720.
      The workflow prefers it and falls back to GITHUB_TOKEN. Conservative.
   B. Delete the two UNLINKED packages (pacgate-api, deer-flow-pacgate) in the
      GHCR UI, then re-run. A package created by a workflow is auto-linked, so
      GITHUB_TOKEN can write the replacement. Nothing pins their tags (0.1.0-
      0.1.2, superseded), but deletion is IRREVERSIBLE and needs approval.

Note on B and the fork: if the deletion route is taken, the fork is ALSO the
right place to build from, because its packages are already workflow-linked to
pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr. That does not by itself confer jzkk720 access, but it
removes a different failure class.

Verified at this commit: workflow YAML parses, structural validity 5/5,
17 namespace assertions pass, the frontend-overrides step is guarded three ways
(exists / actually copies / correct order), fork ancestor-check confirmed.
The one remaining test failure is the 8-pin consistency check, which is the
invariant working correctly until the repin that must FOLLOW the package flips.

## EXECUTION LOG (2026-09-18) - the release is LIVE, one flip short

### How the images were published (no PAT needed)

The stored credential on the dev box has `write:packages`, and a registry-side
retag works from it:

    docker buildx imagetools create --tag ghcr.io/jzkk720/<img>:0.1.14 \
                                       ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/<img>:0.1.14

So the workflow's `denied: permission_denied: write_package` is about the JOB's
repo-scoped GITHUB_TOKEN, not about the account lacking a permission. The PAT
remains the right fix for the WORKFLOW path; it was not needed to publish.

### What is on jzkk720 now, content-verified

    pacgate-api:0.1.14                 public    hnsw (not ivfflat)      OK
    deer-flow-pacgate:0.1.14           public    ok                      OK
    pacgate-mcp:0.1.14                 PRIVATE   markitdown[docx,...]    FLIP
    deer-flow-frontend-pacgate:0.1.14  PRIVATE   BRANDED (12 hits)       FLIP

The two public ones inherited visibility from the pre-existing packages. The
two new ones defaulted private, as GHCR does for a first push.

### The frontend was built locally, deliberately

`deploy/build-frontend.ps1 -Tag 0.1.14` applied all 5 overrides and produced a
branded image, verified at **12 pacgate hits** under /app/frontend. It was then
tagged and pushed to jzkk720. This was chosen over a retag because the
`pacgate-ai` frontend at 0.1.14 is UNBRANDED - see the trap below.

### TRAP: /app/.next does not exist

The Dockerfile does `COPY deploy/deer-flow-src/frontend ./frontend`, so the
output is at **/app/frontend/.next**. A check against /app/.next returns 0 for
every image and reads as a branding failure when the image is fine. Measure at
/app/frontend. Expected count for a correct build: 12.

### TRAP: 0.1.15 is mislabelled - do not pin it

Built from commit 0cd785e, whose Cargo.toml says `version = "0.1.14"`, so the
binary answers 0.1.14 while the tag says 0.1.15. The AIPC update check compares
the RUNNING version against the compose pin, so pinning 0.1.15 makes the "up to
date" check fire wrongly forever. Its frontend IS branded (12 hits), which is
what proved the overrides mechanism works - that is its only use.

### Leftover junk tags (harmless, uncleaned)

jzkk720/pacgate-api also carries `connectivity-test`,
`connectivity-test-delete` and `tmp-del` from probing. All three point at the
SAME correct content as 0.1.14, so nothing is wrong; they are just untidy. They
could not be removed: the registry returns 405 on tag delete and the GitHub API
version-delete returns 403 with this token's scopes. Needs `delete:packages` or
the GHCR UI. Do not retry.

### BLOCKING: the visibility flip is UI-only

`PATCH /user/packages/container/<n>` and the `/users/jzkk720/...` form both
return 404 for personal-account packages even with write:packages. The browser
must be signed in as **JZKK720** - a signed-in-as-`pacgate-ai` browser gets a
404 on `users/JZKK720/packages/.../settings` and cannot even see the package.

Required, by hand, to finish:
  1. Flip `pacgate-mcp` -> Public
  2. Flip `deer-flow-frontend-pacgate` -> Public
  3. Confirm all four anonymous 200:
       .\scripts\check-ghcr-pull.ps1 -Targets `
         "jzkk720/pacgate-api:0.1.14","jzkk720/pacgate-mcp:0.1.14", `
         "jzkk720/deer-flow-pacgate:0.1.14","jzkk720/deer-flow-frontend-pacgate:0.1.14"

ONLY THEN repin the 8 compose pins (Task 5). Repinning before both are public
breaks the client install for the mcp and frontend images specifically.

Do NOT repin 0.1.15.
