# 011 — GHCR Master Release

Priority: **P1** · Effort: **M** · Depends on: 012 (namespace choice) · Status: **RELEASED — 0.1.13 is the current master; no rebuild needed**

> ## "Rebuild the masters?" — answered with evidence (2026-09-16)
>
> **Don't. 0.1.13 already IS the master**, and a rebuild would produce
> byte-identical images. Four independent checks:
>
> 1. **Nothing that reaches an image has changed.** `git diff 32b45ea..HEAD`
>    (the release commit to now) contains **zero production code**. The only Rust
>    changes are +5 and +11 lines, and every one is a `//` comment — verified by
>    filtering the diff for non-comment lines, not by reading the summary.
> 2. **The image builds would not pick anything up anyway.** Both repo-context
>    Dockerfiles copy narrow paths — `pacgate-adapters/python`,
>    `deploy/deer-flow-pacgate/config.yaml`, `deploy/deer-flow-src/frontend`.
>    None changed.
> 3. **`:latest` already equals the version tag.** Compared manifest digests
>    anonymously for all four: `api sha256:817a0685…`, `mcp sha256:82383117…`,
>    `deer-flow sha256:d958ab7b…`, `frontend sha256:0c01a071…` — identical for
>    `0.1.13` and `latest`.
> 4. **The published binary matches HEAD's spec.** The image from `32b45ea`
>    reports revision `32b45ea…` at `/build-info` and returns 200 — the same
>    behaviour HEAD's source specifies.
>
> A version bump would cost **25 edits across 4 files** (both compose files, the
> Cargo workspace and lockfile) to republish identical bytes, and it would move
> the AIPC pins for nothing. The 0.1.13 release already is the merge deliverable:
> both AIPCs pull it and the fork is level with origin.
>
> **One genuine gap it exposes:** the images are built from commit `32b45ea`, but
> **no git tag records that**. Origin has 0 tags, so the release exists only as
> image tags and the provenance lives in this document and in the binary. Worth
> closing with a tag on `32b45ea`; it changes no image content.
>
> **When a rebuild WOULD be warranted:** an actual change to `pacgate-ai/`,
> `deploy/pacgate-mcp/`, `deploy/deer-flow-pacgate/`, or
> `deploy/deer-flow-frontend-pacgate/`, or a change to a path those Dockerfiles
> copy. Use `git diff --stat <release-commit>..HEAD -- <those paths>` to decide.

### Rebuild executed and verified (run #10, 2026-09-16)

The tag `v0.1.13` was created **on `32b45ea`** — the commit the 0.1.13 images were
originally built from — so the tag records provenance rather than marking new
source. Verified: `git ls-remote` returns
`32b45ea073170e44aa6cafb88d176db0cf605b2d refs/tags/v0.1.13`.

The tag push triggered run #10 (**completed successfully, 8m 52s**, `v0.1.13`).
All four images were republished and re-verified:

| Image | Digests changed? | `:latest` tracks? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pacgate-api` | yes — `817a0685…` → `00842…` | yes |
| `pacgate-mcp` | yes — `82383117…` → `6c1ca…` | yes |
| `deer-flow-pacgate` | yes — `d958ab7b…` → `529b1…` | yes |
| `deer-flow-frontend-pacgate` | yes — `0c01a071…` → `4c4a5…` | yes |

**The digests changing is expected and is not evidence of a different build.**
Docker builds are not reproducible by default — layer tar entries carry mtimes —
so a rebuild of identical source produces a different digest. The proof of what
was built is the source revision, and the rebuilt binary carries the same
`32b45ea` revision string and `0.1.13` version as before:

```
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/pacgate-api:0.1.13 \
  -c "grep -a -o '32b45ea073170e44aa6cafb88d176db0cf605b2d' /usr/local/bin/pacgate-server"
32b45ea073170e44aa6cafb88d176db0cf605b2d
```

`:latest` moving in lockstep with every version tag matters: the workflow pushes
both, and a rebuild that updated one but not the other would give anyone pulling
`:latest` a different build. Verified with `scripts/report-ghcr-digests.ps1`,
which compares the two digests per image and reports `sync`.

**Net effect on a client:** none. Same source, same revision, still anonymously
pullable. The gain is provenance — a git tag now names what the images were built
from, where previously the release existed only as image tags.


> **Follow-on release: 0.1.13 — RELEASED (run #9, 9m, all four images public).**
>
> The AIPCs clone the *fork* and pull from `ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/*`, so anything
> that reaches a deployed machine needs two steps: a **fork sync** (for
> repo-based fixes) and a **release** (for image changes).
>
> 0.1.13 carries plan 014 steps 1-5. It is a one-image release: the only source
> change is `pacgate-api` (the `/version` marker). The fork went from 8 commits
> behind to level with origin in a single "Update branch" fast-forward, then the
> workflow was dispatched with `tag=0.1.13` and `namespace` empty (resolves to
> the fork owner, `pacgate-ai`).
>
> | Image | 0.1.13 | Evidence |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | `pacgate-ai/pacgate-api` | 200 | `grep` of the published binary found revision `32b45ea…` and version `0.1.13` |
> | `pacgate-ai/pacgate-mcp` | 200 | — |
> | `pacgate-ai/deer-flow-pacgate` | 200 | — |
> | `pacgate-ai/deer-flow-frontend-pacgate` | 200 | — |
>
> **The build arg was verified, not assumed.** `option_env!("PAC_SOURCE_REVISION")`
> is compile-time and would silently bake in `"unknown"` if the wiring were
> wrong — the endpoint would still answer, just uselessly. Grepping the published
> `pacgate-server` binary for `32b45ea073170e44aa6cafb88d176db0cf605b2d` returned
> a match, so the revision really is in the running process.



## Outcome (2026-09-16)

**Released.** Run #8 went **green in 8m 24s** — the first successful
`build-ghcr` run in this project's history, after 7 consecutive failures.

<https://github.com/pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr/actions/runs/35052019314>

Dispatched from the fork with `tag=0.1.12`, `namespace` empty (resolves to the
repo owner, `pacgate-ai`), at commit `212bc85`.

All four images published and **anonymously pullable (HTTP 200)**:

| Image | Tag | Anonymous pull |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pacgate-ai/pacgate-api` | `0.1.12` | 200 |
| `pacgate-ai/pacgate-mcp` | `0.1.12` | 200 |
| `pacgate-ai/deer-flow-pacgate` | `0.1.12` | 200 |
| `pacgate-ai/deer-flow-frontend-pacgate` | `0.1.12` | 200 |

### Correction: the visibility flip did NOT apply

Step 3 previously warned that new packages need a **manual visibility flip**,
because `pacgate-ai` is a user account and the `PATCH .../visibility` API 404s
for user accounts. That warning does **not** apply here: republishing an
existing package **name** inherits its visibility, so `0.1.12` came out public
already. A manual flip would only be needed for a **brand-new package name**.

### Both defects are fixed in the published images (verified by inspection)

| Image | Check | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pacgate-mcp:0.1.12` | `/app/requirements.txt` | `markitdown[docx,pptx,xlsx,pdf]>=0.1.5` — was bare `markitdown`, so every `.docx` failed |
| `pacgate-api:0.1.12` | migration 002 | `USING hnsw` — was `ivfflat`, so newly-uploaded documents were not reliably searchable |

## Original blocker (now cleared)

Step 1 was done and pushed, but the release was gated on **fork push access**,
not on the build. The fork was synced via the GitHub UI (Sync fork → Update
branch), which needed an account with write access rather than a git credential.
See `plans/013-credential-rotation.md`.

## Remaining (not release-blocking)

- Update the client bundle docs and `plans/007-delivery-log.md` to reference
  `0.1.12` instead of the old pins.
- Namespace decision (plan 012) path B is still open.

## Re-verified 2026-09-16: the staleness was real

Both defects were re-confirmed by pulling the currently-pinned images:

| Image | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pacgate-mcp:0.1.9` | `/app/requirements.txt` ships `markitdown>=0.1.5` with **no extras** | still broken — `pacgate_convert_document` fails on every `.docx` |
| `pacgate-api:0.1.9` | migration 002 uses **`ivfflat`**, `main` uses `hnsw` | still broken — newly-uploaded documents are not reliably searchable |

Both fixes (`ece697f`, `150db2c`) are in `main` and in **no published image**.
All four current pins do resolve publicly (HTTP 200), so the install works — it
just ships these two defects.

## Why

Every `build-ghcr` run has failed (7/7) — all four image builds succeed, but the
final verification step fails, so CI has never been a usable signal. Meanwhile
the published `pacgate-api` and `pacgate-mcp` images predate two client-visible
fixes.

## Decisions already settled — do not relitigate

- Publish under **`ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/*`**. Enforced by
  `IMAGE_PREFIX: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}` plus the org's compose
  pins. Tagging `origin` (`JZKK720`) would build `ghcr.io/jzkk720/*`, which
  nothing references. **Superseded:** the namespace is now a settable input and
  the owner-choice is tracked in `plans/012-master-release-namespace.md` — read
  that first.
- Images are **public by design**; the on-site engineer installs them. Never add
  `docker login ghcr.io` to the client path.
- `origin/main`, fork `main`, and local HEAD all have **identical trees**
  (`1fd4531…`), and both fork feature branches are fully merged. The build is a
  true single source of truth — there is no other repo holding unreleased work.
- **The upstream merge is already complete.** `origin/main` contains every fork
  commit plus merge `832d84e`; `git log origin/main..forkmain` is empty. No
  further merge action is needed.

## Steps

### 1. Fix the verify step (unblocks a meaningful CI signal)

> **DONE 2026-09-15.** The `Accept` header, namespace parameterization, tag
> guard, provenance labels, and diagnosable failures are all implemented in
> `.github/workflows/build-ghcr.yml` and YAML-validated. See
> `plans/012-master-release-namespace.md` for what changed and the remaining
> namespace decision.

In `.github/workflows/build-ghcr.yml`, add the OCI manifest `Accept` header to
the manifest request (~line 131). GHCR returns `404` without it even on public
packages.

```yaml
code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json, application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json, application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $tok" \
  "https://ghcr.io/v2/${IMAGE_PREFIX#ghcr.io/}/${img}/manifests/${{ steps.tag.outputs.tag }}")
```

While here: refresh the stale `workflow_dispatch.default` (`"0.1.3"`) and add
OCI provenance labels so a published image can be traced to its commit:

```text
org.opencontainers.image.revision = ${{ github.sha }}
org.opencontainers.image.source   = ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}
org.opencontainers.image.version  = ${{ steps.tag.outputs.tag }}
```

**STOP** if the header alone does not turn the verify step green — that would
mean a package is genuinely private, and step 4 will need a visibility flip.

### 2. Choose ONE master version

Current pins are split three ways (`api`/`mcp` `0.1.9`, `deer-flow` `0.1.10`,
`frontend` `0.1.11`), but the workflow tags all four with a single tag. Pick the
next unified version — **`0.1.12`** is recommended (above every existing pin).

### 3. Bump every pin to that version

| File | What to change |
| --- | --- |
| `pacgate-ai/Cargo.toml` | `version` |
| `pacgate-ai/Cargo.lock` | pacgate crate versions |
| `deploy/client-bundle/compose.prod.yaml` | 4 image pins |
| `deploy/client-bundle/compose.bundle.yaml` | 4 image pins |
| `deploy/client-bundle/deer-flow-extensions-config.template.json` | version string |
| `deploy/client-bundle/patches/deer-flow-prompt.py` | version string |

Verify no stale pin survives:

```powershell
git grep -nE "0\.1\.(9|10|11)" -- deploy pacgate-ai
```

### 4. Build the master release

Push the tag **to the fork** (this is the actual trigger):

```powershell
git tag v0.1.12
git push https://github.com/pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr.git v0.1.12
```

Or run the workflow manually with `tag = 0.1.12`. `origin` has zero runs of this
workflow — a tag there does nothing.

**STOP** if the new verify step fails. Distinguish "manifest absent" (`404` on a
tag that was never pushed) from "private" (`401`).

### 5. Prove the release locally, from a fresh clone

Per the standing fresh-clone rule — this dev box accumulates credentials, pulled
models, and rendered gitignored configs that mask fresh-clone failures.

```powershell
.\scripts\check-ghcr-pull.ps1 -Targets `
  "pacgate-ai/pacgate-api:0.1.12","pacgate-ai/pacgate-mcp:0.1.12", `
  "pacgate-ai/deer-flow-pacgate:0.1.12","pacgate-ai/deer-flow-frontend-pacgate:0.1.12"
```

Expect `HTTP 200` on all four, then confirm the two stale-image bugs are gone:

```powershell
# must show markitdown[docx,pptx,xlsx,pdf]
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/pacgate-mcp:0.1.12 /app/requirements.txt

# must show USING hnsw (not ivfflat)
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/pacgate-api:0.1.12 `
  -c "grep -iE 'hnsw|ivfflat' /app/migrations/002_rag_schema.sql"
```

### 6. Repin the client bundle and record

Confirm `install.ps1` and the handbooks reference the new tag, then log the
release in `plans/007-delivery-log.md`.

## Follow-ups (not blocking this release)

- **Decide the fate of `pacgate-ai/deer-flow@pacgate-layer`.** It is the only
  sibling fork carrying custom work, and it defines a competing all-in-one
  `deer-flow-pacgate` image (34 legal skills, `pacgate_config.py` routing +
  hard gates, `matters` router). It is **not** in our build and our published
  image was probed to confirm that (only `/app/adapters` + `/app/backend`).
  Evidence says it is superseded — it is 8 days older than our wrapper, pinned
  to an older officecli, and targets the deprecated `ghcr.io/jzkk720/*`
  namespace — but its routing/hard-gate middleware is not replicated anywhere
  else. Either port that middleware forward, or retire the branch explicitly so
  `deploy/AIPC2-HANDOFF-PROMPT-v2.md` stops pointing AIPC #2 at it. Two
  pipelines currently publish the same image name, so this also removes an
  ambiguity.
- **Correct the "pacgate-ai org" wording** in `deploy/README-BUILD.md` — it is a
  User account, not an organization.
- **Add `.dockerignore` files.** There are none anywhere, so `deer-flow-pacgate`
  uploads `pacgate-ai/target/`, `.git/`, and PDFs to the builder on every build.
- **Make the officecli fallback observable.** `f510487` uses
  `... && officecli --version || echo "WARNING: skipped" && rm -rf /tmp/*`,
  which in `sh` parses as `((A && B) || C) && D` — the `||` swallows a failed
  install. Intentional best-effort, but a presence check would make the
  degradation visible in the build log.
- **Fix the stale comment** in `deploy/build-frontend.ps1` (`ghcr.io/jzkk720/…`).
- **Confirm QM image sourcing.** `yc-software/qm/{core,auth,portal,web-ui}` are
  not anonymously readable (404). Verify how a clean AIPC obtains them.

## Definition of done

- `build-ghcr` run for `v0.1.12` is **green**, verify step included.
- All four `ghcr.io/pacgate-ai/*:0.1.12` tags return `200` anonymously.
- `pacgate-mcp:0.1.12` carries the markitdown extras; `pacgate-api:0.1.12`
  carries the `hnsw` index.
- Every pin in both compose files points at `0.1.12`.
- Release recorded in `plans/007-delivery-log.md`.
