# Pacgate AI - Two-AIPC Deployment Handbook

> Clone the repo on each machine, run the same install steps, and both machines become fully operational with deer-flow research and qm collaboration.
> Version 0.1.3 - 2026-09-02
> Prerequisites: Docker Desktop, Ollama, Node.js 24+. `install.ps1` pulls the models listed in `ollama-models.txt`.

## ⚠️ Significant findings (2026-09-02) — read before deploying AIPC #2

These were discovered during the AIPC #1 pilot and are **already fixed in this repo**.
AIPC #2 must pull the **updated** code (from `pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr`, see Stage 1) so it
gets these fixes, not the older `JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr` main.

1. **deer-flow agent could not query pacgate's legal databases.** Root cause: no tool was
   wired to pacgate-api's `/api/kb/search` (RAG) or `/api/search` (legal connectors), and the
   memory adapter silently fell back to local files (`PacgateMemoryStorage requires
   PACGATE_MATTER_ID`). **Fix:** a new `pacgate-mcp` service (FastMCP) exposes
   `pacgate_kb_search`, `pacgate_connector_search`, `pacgate_list_connectors` to deer-flow.
   Registered in `deer-flow-extensions-config.json` beside openviking.

2. **openviking MCP had the wrong API key baked in.** `deer-flow-extensions-config.json`
   used the app key (`OPENVIKING_API_KEY`) but openviking's `root_api_key` is
   `OPENVIKING_ROOT_API_KEY`. A wrong key made openviking return 401, which rolled back the
   **entire** MCP tool load (deer-flow uses `asyncio.gather`), so **no** MCP tools appeared.
   **Fix:** use `OPENVIKING_ROOT_API_KEY` (template now uses `${OPENVIKING_ROOT_API_KEY}`).

3. **`docker compose up -d --force-recreate deer-flow` wipes deer-flow's local DB.**
   The SQLite DB, admin user, threads, and `.jwt_secret` live at `/app/backend/.deer-flow/`
   **inside the container** (not mounted). Recreating the container loses them → the frontend
   gets 401 and the `/setup` page appears. **Use `docker compose restart deer-flow`** for
   config changes; only recreate if you accept losing the local DB (then re-run `/setup`).

4. **QM sign-in needs a `RESEND_API_KEY`, not Outlook SMTP.** The old SMTP path
   (`smtp.office365.com` + app password) is broken — Microsoft retired Basic Auth / app
   passwords for Exchange Online (Sep 2025). `qm check` failed with
   `535 5.7.139 Authentication unsuccessful`. **Fix:** qm's auth broker now uses the
   **Resend** transport (`AUTH_EMAIL_TRANSPORT=resend`). You must supply a `RESEND_API_KEY`
   in `deploy/qm-pacgate/.env` (see Stage 4).

5. **The qm web-ui cannot self-authenticate.** Its server (`/app/server/index.ts`) sets
   `AUTH_MODE = COOKIE_AUTH ? "dev" : "portal"`. Because `CORE_SIGNING_SECRET` is set,
   it's in **portal** mode and requires a portal-issued identity token. There is **no
   no-secret way** to reach the web-ui directly — you must run `portal`+`auth` (Resend) or
   an external OIDC provider. `ADMIN_GRANTS` is an authorization seed, not a sign-in.

6. **Git push to `JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr` is blocked for the `pacgate-ai` account** (403,
   needs 2FA grant). **Workaround:** the `pacgate-ai` account can create a fork and push
   there. The fork `pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr` now carries all fixes on `main`.

## Architecture: two identical machines

Both AIPCs run the complete stack:

```
Each AIPC machine:
  nginx :8081  -> pacgate-api :8080 (Rust metadata API)
                -> deer-flow  :8001 (research workspace)
  Postgres :5432 (local metadata DB)
  OpenViking :1933 (long-term memory lane, MCP)
  qm :8182 (co-working workspace, runs via `qm up`)
  Ollama :11434 (native, GPU/NPU)
```

Each machine is self-contained and independently operational. Lawyers on either machine can use both research mode (deer-flow at `http://localhost:8081/research/`) and collaboration mode (qm at `http://localhost:8182`) without depending on the other machine.

If you later want shared matter data across both machines, connect them with a private mesh (Tailscale or WireGuard) and decide on a sync or single-authority model. That is a post-pilot decision, not a deployment prerequisite.

## What you need before starting

- GitHub access to `JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr` (private repo) — a PAT or `gh auth login`
- Docker Desktop running on both AIPCs
- Ollama running on both AIPCs (`install.ps1` pulls the models it needs)
- `ollama signin` completed on each AIPC if the cloud-tagged deepseek models are in use
- Node.js 24+ installed on both AIPCs (for qm)
- **No `docker login ghcr.io` needed** — the Pacgate runtime images are published as
  **public** GHCR packages (see Stage 0). Only the source repo is private.

## Stage 0: Runtime images (dev machine, already done)

The runtime is published on GHCR and needs no rebuild on the AIPC:

| Image | Status |
|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/jzkk720/pacgate-api:0.1.2` | Published. Fixes the 0.1.1 container-networking bug (LLM router honors `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, per-tenant model overrides applied). |
| `ghcr.io/jzkk720/deer-flow-pacgate:0.1.0` | Published. Thin wrapper on the upstream deer-flow backend; unchanged. |
| `ghcr.io/volcengine/openviking@sha256:46f9e34c…` | Pinned by digest in `compose.prod.yaml`. Upstream public image. |

**Both Pacgate packages must be set to public visibility on GHCR** so an AIPC can pull
without registry credentials. Verify before rollout:

```powershell
# Expect HTTP 200 with no docker login. 401/403 means the package is still private.
# (The Accept header is required — omit it and a public manifest returns 404, not 200.)
$acc = "application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json,application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.list.v2+json,application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json"
$t = (Invoke-RestMethod "https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:jzkk720/pacgate-api:pull").token
(Invoke-WebRequest "https://ghcr.io/v2/jzkk720/pacgate-api/manifests/0.1.2" -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $t"; Accept=$acc} -Method Head -UseBasicParsing).StatusCode
```

To flip it (GitHub web UI — the API route 404s for personal accounts):
GitHub → your profile → Packages → `pacgate-api` → Package settings → Visibility →
**Public** → Save. Repeat for `deer-flow-pacgate`. This is safe: the images contain only
the compiled binary and SQL migrations, every secret is injected at runtime via `.env`,
and the installer already has full source access to the same code.

Only rebuild and push if the Rust source changes, from the dev machine:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\cubecloud-io\github-pr\pacgate-ai-pr
docker build -t ghcr.io/jzkk720/pacgate-api:0.1.3 -f pacgate-ai/Dockerfile ./pacgate-ai
docker push ghcr.io/jzkk720/pacgate-api:0.1.3
```

Then bump the tag in `deploy/client-bundle/compose.prod.yaml`.

Do **not** rebuild on the AIPC — the pilot runs the published digests.

> **Port conflict note:** the stack binds nginx to host port `8081`. If that port is already in use on the machine, edit the `ports:` entry for `nginx` in `deploy/client-bundle/compose.prod.yaml` (e.g. `"8089:80"`) and use the new port in all verification URLs below.

## Stage 1: Clone the repo on each AIPC

On both machines:

```powershell
cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr.git
cd pacgate-ai-pr
```

> **AIPC #2 note:** clone from the **`pacgate-ai/pacgate-ai-pr`** fork (it carries all the
> 2026-09-02 fixes on `main`). The `pacgate-ai` account owns it, so it's writable and always
> up to date. If you must use `JZKK720/pacgate-ai-pr`, pull the `feat/deer-flow-pacgate-mcp`
> branch (or apply the patches in `patches/`) to get the same fixes.

If the repo is private and GitHub prompts for credentials, use a personal access token or the GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`).

## Stage 2: Deploy the core stack (both machines, identical steps)

Run these steps on each AIPC. The Docker Compose stack starts pacgate-api, Postgres, nginx, and deer-flow.

```powershell
cd C:\pacgate-ai-pr\deploy\client-bundle
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env
```

Fill in these values:

```
PACGATE_DB_PASSWORD=<generate a strong password>
PACGATE_JWT_SECRET=<generate a random hex string>
PACGATE_TENANT_ID=pacgate-law
OPENVIKING_ROOT_API_KEY=<generate a 32-char hex string>
OPENVIKING_API_KEY=<generate a 32-char hex string>
```

`OPENVIKING_API_KEY` is **required** — the installer renders
`deer-flow-extensions-config.json` from it and stops with an error if it is
missing or left as `change-me`.

Generate secrets if you need them:

```powershell
# DB password (16 hex)
-join ((1..16) | ForEach-Object { '{0:x}' -f (Get-Random -Maximum 16) })

# JWT secret (32 hex)
-join ((1..32) | ForEach-Object { '{0:x}' -f (Get-Random -Maximum 16) })

# OpenViking keys (32 hex each) — generate a fresh value per line
-join ((1..32) | ForEach-Object { '{0:x}' -f (Get-Random -Maximum 16) })
```

Run the installer:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

The installer pulls the (public, no-login) GHCR images, renders `OPENVIKING_CONF_CONTENT`
and `deer-flow-extensions-config.json` from the `.env` secrets, starts the Docker Compose
stack, and pulls the Ollama models listed in `ollama-models.txt`. If models are already
pulled, this step is fast.

Verify the core stack:

```powershell
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml ps
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```

Expected: all five containers running (pacgate-db, pacgate-api, deer-flow, openviking, nginx) and `/health` returns `ok`.

## Stage 3: Seed the tenant and register users (both machines)

On each machine, seed the default tenant and register the admin user:

```powershell
# Seed the tenant
docker exec pacgate-db psql -U pacgate -c "INSERT INTO tenants (name, slug) VALUES ('Pacgate Law', 'pacgate-law');"

# Register the admin user
$body = @{email="admin@pacgate-law.com"; password="<strong-password>"} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/auth/register" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

Register a qm bridge service account (needed by qm to authenticate with pacgate-api):

```powershell
$body = @{email="qm-bridge@pacgate.local"; password="<strong-bridge-password>"} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/auth/register" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

## Stage 3.5: Verify OpenViking memory service (both machines)

OpenViking is the long-term memory lane: deer-flow and qm store conversational
context there and recall it in later sessions. It starts as part of the compose
stack.

```powershell
curl http://localhost:1933/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok","healthy":true,...}`. The installer renders the
OpenViking config (Ollama embedding + VLM) into `.env` as
`OPENVIKING_CONF_CONTENT` and seeds the server's `ov.conf` on first boot.

Functional check (optional, uses the root key from `.env`):

```powershell
$key = (Get-Content .env | Select-String '^OPENVIKING_ROOT_API_KEY=').Line.Split('=')[1]
$body = '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
curl.exe -s -X POST http://localhost:1933/mcp -H "X-API-Key: $key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" -d $body
```

Expected: a tool list including `find`, `search`, `read`, `remember`.

Boundary rule: OpenViking stores conversational context only (decisions,
preferences, working knowledge). Matter documents and T1-T4-controlled content
stay in pacgate-api/pacgate-rag.

## Stage 4: Bootstrap qm (both machines, identical steps)

qm runs separately from the Docker Compose stack. Bootstrap it on each machine after the core stack is healthy.

```powershell
cd C:\pacgate-ai-pr\deploy\client-bundle
.\setup-qm.ps1
```

The script prompts for:
- Administrator work email (lowercased)
- Pacgate bridge email: `qm-bridge@pacgate.local`
- Pacgate bridge password: the one you registered in Stage 3

The script generates signing secrets, creates `.env` in the qm-pacgate directory, validates the config with `qm check`, and builds the sandbox image with `qm sandbox build`.

**QM sign-in requires a Resend API key.** The qm auth broker delivers sign-in magic links
via **Resend** (`AUTH_EMAIL_TRANSPORT=resend`), not Outlook SMTP (Microsoft retired Basic
Auth / app passwords for Exchange Online). Before `qm up` will start `portal`+`auth`, set
`RESEND_API_KEY` in `deploy/qm-pacgate/.env`:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Also set `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` to a **Resend-verified sender** (an Outlook address is not
verified). Either verify a real domain (e.g. `pacgate-law.com`) in Resend, or use Resend's
test sender for now:
```
AUTH_EMAIL_FROM="PacGate <onboarding@resend.dev>"
```

Start qm:

```powershell
cd C:\pacgate-ai-pr\deploy\qm-pacgate
node_modules\.bin\qm.cmd up
```

> **Note:** `npm exec qm -- up` may be blocked by the PowerShell execution policy
> (`npm.ps1`). Use `node_modules\.bin\qm.cmd up` instead.

Verify qm:

```powershell
# Open http://localhost:8182  (web-ui) — requires a portal identity token
# Open http://localhost:8181  (portal) — the sign-in front door
# Sign in with the admin email (magic link via Resend)
# Send a test message
# Ask: "List available pacgate workflows"
```

> **Web-ui auth reality:** the qm web-ui (`:8182`) cannot authenticate anyone on its own —
> it must be reached through the portal (`:8181`), which issues the identity token. If you
> open `:8182` directly you'll see "reached through the portal." Always go through `:8181`.

## Stage 5: Verify deer-flow (both machines)

On each machine, verify the research workspace:

```powershell
# Open http://localhost:8081/research/
# Select or create a matter
# Ask: "Summarize recent force majeure case law in China"
# Verify: response includes citations
# Verify: response is saved to matter memory
```

## Stage 6: Smoke test checklist (both machines)

Run this checklist on each AIPC independently.

### Core stack

- [ ] `docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml ps` shows 5 services up (incl. openviking)
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:8081/health` returns `ok`
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:1933/health` returns healthy JSON
- [ ] Postgres has the `pacgate-law` tenant
- [ ] Admin user can log in at `http://localhost:8081/api/auth/login`
- [ ] deer-flow returns a real research response at `http://localhost:8081/research/`

### qm collaboration

- [ ] `npm exec qm -- status` shows qm running
- [ ] `http://localhost:8182` loads the qm web UI
- [ ] Admin can sign in
- [ ] qm can list Pacgate workflow categories
- [ ] qm can execute one Pacgate workflow through the bridge

### Ollama

- [ ] `ollama list` shows the required models
- [ ] deer-flow can call Ollama for inference
- [ ] qm can call Ollama for inference

### Data

- [ ] `./data/tenants/` directory exists and is writable
- [ ] `./openviking/` directory exists and persists across restarts
- [ ] Document upload works through the API
- [ ] Matter memory persists after a deer-flow research run
- [ ] Cross-session recall: a fact stored via OpenViking `remember` is recalled via `search` in a later session

## Managing the stack after deployment

### Start and stop

```powershell
# Start core stack
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml up -d

# Stop core stack
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml down

# Start qm
cd C:\pacgate-ai-pr\deploy\qm-pacgate
npm exec qm -- up

# Stop qm
npm exec qm -- down
```

### Update to a new version

```powershell
cd C:\pacgate-ai-pr
git pull
cd deploy\client-bundle
.\install.ps1 -Update
```

The update pulls new GHCR images and restarts containers. Data is preserved:
- `./data/tenants/` (volume mount) - matters, documents, memory
- Postgres data (named volume) - metadata database

### Switch models

deer-flow (research workspace):
1. Edit `deer-flow-config.yaml` - reorder the `models` list (first entry = default)
2. Restart: `docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml restart deer-flow`

qm (co-working workspace):
1. Edit `qm-pacgate/qm.config.jsonc` - change `MODEL_NAME`
2. Restart: `cd qm-pacgate && npm exec qm -- down && npm exec qm -- up`

### Register new users

```powershell
$body = @{email="<user>@pacgate-law.com"; password="<password>"} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8081/api/auth/register" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

### Backup the database

```powershell
docker exec pacgate-db pg_dump -U pacgate pacgate > backup.sql
```

### Check logs

```powershell
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml logs -f pacgate-api
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml logs -f deer-flow
```

## Known limitations

- Each machine has its own independent Postgres and `./data/tenants/` directory. Matter data is not shared between machines unless you later add a private mesh and a sync or single-authority model.
- The PkuLaw connector token is expired. Regenerate it at `https://mcp.pkulaw.com` and set `PKULAW_API_KEY` in `.env` if China-law search is needed during the pilot.
- Four WASM crates (citation-check, clause-parser, doc-validator, rule-engine) remain stubs. These are future-blueprint work and do not affect Phase 1 pilot functionality.
- **Model selection:** the API defaults to models that may not exist on the target machine. After Stage 3, apply per-tenant model overrides so the LLM tiers point at models actually present in `ollama list` on that machine. Recommended pilot set (benchmarked 2026-08-28): `gemma4:12b-it-qat` (Main — 13s/tool-round, schema-valid tool calls, verified end-to-end), `qwen3.8:27b-mtp-q4_K_M` (Mid — 73s/tool-round, stronger quality for batch tabular review), `nomic-embed-text:latest` (embeddings). Avoid reasoning-mode models (e.g. nemotron) for interactive tiers — they can hang long docx generations. See `plans/007-aipc-full-installation-handoff.md` Appendix A for the SQL template.
